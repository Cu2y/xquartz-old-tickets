256 color visual produces white-on-white / blank windows
========================================================


I was starting with the stock X11 with Leopard / 10.5.1, and found that when I set X11 Preferences to 256 colors, then all windows come up white-on-white. I can type in the XTerm, for example, and the control-mouse-click menus come up (also blank / white-on-white). I've set explicit foreground/background colors in .Xdefaults, which work with Millions of colors.

I upgraded to XQuartz 2.1.3, and the situation is much the same, except now (maybe, not sure I remember right) the cursor is now colored according to the foreground color.

Thanks,
==Leonard
