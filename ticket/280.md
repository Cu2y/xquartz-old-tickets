freetype linking against Carbon
===============================


libfreetype.6.dylib links against Carbon for FSPathMakeRef. However, this ends up making Freetype unsafe to use from forking applications, such as urxvtd. (The symptom: crash as soon as you try to display something that requires a character that isn't in the default font.)

Is the use of Carbon here avoidable? If not, is there some way to make it safe for use in forking applications?
