quartz-wm incorrectly validates window geometry in multi-monitor mode
=====================================================================


As of 2.5.0, xterm seems to be restricting the allowable Y geometry (rows) to those that will fit on the default display, even if the location specified is on a different (larger) display.

Using a MBP with builtin 1440x900 display and external 1600x1200 display, xterm -geometry 80x90+0+0 (where +0+0 is the upper left corner of the 1600x1200 display) yields a xterm in the right location, but of size 80x65. 65 happens to be the right number of rows to completely fill the builtin display, but that is not where it is being displayed.

I really despise the window location validation code...

Does this happen with the quartz-wm provided in the 10.6.3 update? (run X11.app instead of XQuartz.app)

The 65 width might make it \*just\* too big to fit on the display.

Please describe how your screens are located relative to each other. A screen-shot of Display Preferences-&gt;Arrangement would be helpful.

No response since original report.

I just tried this now with the 1600x1200 display to the left of the smaller built-in display, and I can't reproduce it (2.6.0\_rc1). I didn't do anything specifically to address this problem, but is seems to just work now.

Closing.

If you can provide more information to help me reproduce the problem, please let me know. A screen shot of your display preferences' Arrangement tab would be helpful.
