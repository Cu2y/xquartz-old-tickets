XQuartz-2.7.2 pkg has invalid signature on Mountain Lion GM
===========================================================


Attempting to install XQuartz-2.7.2 on Mountain Lion GM gives this result:

\# installer -pkg /Volumes/XQuartz-2.7.2/XQuartz.pkg -target /

> installer: Package name is XQuartz 2.7.2
> installer: Certificate used to sign package is not trusted. Use -allowUntrusted to override.

On Lion, pkgutil reports it has a valid signature:

\# pkgutil --check-signature /Volumes/XQuartz-2.7.2/XQuartz.pkg
Package "XQuartz.pkg":

> Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X
> Certificate Chain:

1.  Developer ID Installer: Apple Inc. - XQuartz
2.  Developer ID Certification Authority
3.  Apple Root CA

On Mountain Lion GM:

\# pkgutil --check-signature /Volumes/XQuartz-2.7.2/XQuartz.pkg
Package "XQuartz.pkg":

> Status: invalid signature

This may actually be a Mountain Lion bug, but thought it best to report here as well.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.3*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

Please file a radar at <http://bugreport.apple.com> and include your full system profile. Have you had trouble with any other packages?

It seems to be working fine here (on Mountain Lion):

    $  pkgutil --check-signature /Volumes/XQuartz-2.7.2/XQuartz.pkg Package "XQuartz.pkg"
    Package "XQuartz.pkg":
       Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X
       Certificate Chain:
        1. Developer ID Installer: Apple Inc. - XQuartz
           SHA1 fingerprint: D7 16 0E A9 7B 4D 04 AB F9 E6 90 61 F3 69 87 5D 4D B5 C0 8A
           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        2. Developer ID Certification Authority
           SHA1 fingerprint: 3B 16 6C 3B 7D C4 B7 51 C9 FE 2A FA B9 13 56 41 E3 88 E1 86
           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        3. Apple Root CA
           SHA1 fingerprint: 61 1E 5B 66 2C 59 3A 08 FF 58 D1 4A E2 24 52 D1 98 DF 6C 60

I'm closing this. Please report the radar number, and I will CC myself on it.

Have not had issues with any other packages; just did a complete rebuild of a machine with Mountain Lion GM (released late yesterday) and installed ~150 packages without incident.

Very strange. Downloaded a new copy of the dmg from <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.2.dmg> and tested on a second Mountain Lion machine with the same result:

"Status: invalid signature"

I'm not going to file a Radar until/unless I can reproduce this with another package.

Please file a radar.

Filed Bug ID\# 11970185 with Apple.
This is definitely an Apple bug, but may not affect all signed packages; XQuartz-2.7.2.pkg was the first package I found that exhibited this issue.

Lion machine:

gneagle@moss:~ % sudo -s

root@moss:~ \# su root
sh-3.2\# whoami
root
sh-3.2\# sw\_vers
ProductName: Mac OS X
ProductVersion: 10.7.4

sh-3.2\# pkgutil --check-signature XQuartz.pkg
Package "XQuartz.pkg":

> Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X
> Certificate Chain:

3.  Apple Root CA
