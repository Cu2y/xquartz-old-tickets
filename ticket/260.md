Aqua stealing focus from X11 (or X11 losing focus to Aqua)
==========================================================


I am experiencing an extremely annoying bug where the focus shifts between the full-screen X11 window and the Aqua desktop. You can see a video of the problem here:

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05J1w3MCLxU>

The focus shifts occur at apparently random intervals, ranging from several hours to 5 seconds.
If a flicker occurs when I'm clicking my mouse button, the aqua window traps the click and stays focused. I have to hit option-command-a to return to X11.

This bug occurs on a newly-created login with absolutely no other programs running, even finder. I am using XQuartz 2.3.2 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple31), and my hardware info is below:

      Model Name:      iMac
      Model Identifier: iMac8,1
      Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo
      Processor Speed:  2.8 GHz

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

This is already reported, and there's nothing we can do about it. If you can figure out what application is stealing focus, we can file that bug with that apps developers... but X11 doesn't "give" focus away. It's stolen.
