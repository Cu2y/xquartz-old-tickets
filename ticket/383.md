X11 crash on launch following security update
=============================================


I stupidly just installed the Apple security update (released 4/14/10) and now X11 won't launch.

I get the following crash report:
Dyld Error Message:

> Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib
> Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
> Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 10.0.0 or later, but libX11.6.dylib provides version 9.0.0

Is there anything I can do to fix this or do I have to wait for a new release of X11?

Thanks
