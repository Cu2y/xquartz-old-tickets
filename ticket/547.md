windows getting out of order
============================


I installed XQuartz yesterday to see if a problem I was having with an app running in wine was better but it actually got worse. I've removed XQuartz and read in the instructions about how I should submit a bug report, so here it is.

What is happening is that when I run the RootsMagic 5 program in CrossoverOffice it opens up lots of subwindows as I zoom in on a person's record. For example, I double click on a person and they open up in a new windows. I double click on a birth entry and it opens a window, etc. The stack of windows may get 3-4 deep. The problem is that the windows don't keep their order, so that one of the in-between windows ends up behind the big main window. I then have to show the app windows in Expose to find the hidden Window.

This was already a problem with the OS X version of X11 and I have opened an incident with Codeweavers. What I found, though, is that the problem is even worse with XQuartz 2.7.0. There the problem is that I would hit the OK button to close the window, and instead of closing it would go behind the big main window. The only way I found to close these windows was to drag the big window out of the way. Then when I clicked OK on the subwindow it would go away. After I removed XQuartz this no longer happened. With XQuartz the front window would go behind the main one, without it only the in-between windows would go behind the main one.

Codeweavers uses their own server and does not use XQuartz. I don't see how the problem could be worse with XQuartz-2.7.0 installed because they don't use it.

The possible issue is that you have XQuartz \*running\* at the same time as Codeweavers. That would cause multiple instances of quartz-wm to be running at the same time, an issue that is known to cause problems.
