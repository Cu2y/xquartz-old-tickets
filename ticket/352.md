under preferences menu
======================


I changed the output so that the screen turns grey when running the watchtower for the background and my other applications are not showing. How do I change it back under preferences, I cant pull up the preference menu. Please give me the directions - running snow lep.

Thanks

You just need to change the preferences back. In the preferences menu, goto "Output" and turn off "Fullscreen Mode"

If you can't access the menu from fullscreen mode because you turned that off as well, you need to leave fullscreen mode with cmd-alt-A
