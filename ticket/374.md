Alt key mapping, in Wine games
==============================


this is a reopen of ticket [\#⁠349](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/349). I tried to just reopen it, but it said i did not have permission.

Alt key is still not working right in Wine games under 2.5.0. No game that uses Alt has a functioning alt key, they are mapped to the wrong thing.... last ticket was closed saying it should be fixed in 2.5.0-rc1.

Macports install as of today (4/2/2010)... Macports devel version as of today, and the Xquartz 2.5.0 release download and install from the .dmg for Snow Leopard .... all still have the same problem. The Alt keys do not map correctly to function as alt.... no change from previous ticket. I didn't expect the 2.5.0 release to work since it was Xorg 1.7.6 ... but even the latest devel 1.7.99.... doesn't work.

Please run 'xev'

What is printed to the console when you press alt while the white xev window is in focus?

Did you not make a ~/.Xmodmap ?

i had not seen that exact posting.. I tried editing xkb configs, and making a xmodmap on my own... neither which seemed to work. I'll try again with the exact syntax off that link.... I wasn't aware it was ever supposed to be like that though, so thats probably it. I'll test it shortly and post back.

It was like that except for the versions shipped with OSX 10.5.0 and 10.5.1

adding a ~/.Xmodmap does seem to fix the problem... not with my old Xquartz build of 2.5.0 with xorg server 1.7.2... but with 2.5.0 release and the 1.7.99.xxx. server.

Is there any way to make it change without ~/.Xmodmap ... or set a different location to load .Xmodmap from? If not, it still works ok.

2.5.0 contains the 1.7.6 server which has this change. I'm guessing your 1.7.2 server was from the alphas or betas.

~/.Xmodmap is where these changes go. I may add a UI option for that to the preferences. If you think that is something useful, please open a new bug for that issue.

Thanks.

I have added a preference option for this which you can use instead of ~/.Xmodmap in the next release.
