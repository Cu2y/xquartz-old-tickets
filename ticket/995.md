XQuartz installer stalls at 'destination select' using OS 10.8.5
================================================================


Installer gets to 'destination select' & stops. 'Install for users...' bar & 'continue' button are both greyed out.

Is this a problem with OS 10.8.5? Is there another version of XQuartz that installs on OS 10.8.5?

Need to run Inkscape on this Mac Mini.

Thanks for any help or advice...

That's Installer.app and has nothing to do with XQuartz (it's part of OS X). Be more patient. There's nothing we can do about it, sorry.
