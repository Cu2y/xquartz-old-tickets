XQuartz and Gimp: buggy window behaviour with Tab key on hiding/unhiding Tool window
====================================================================================


The gimp guys directed me to you, so I post this bug also here.

Annoying buggy behaviour when using Tab key on hiding/unhiding Tool palette inside Gimp. Everytime when using Tab key to hide tool window and thenafter unhide again, tool palette will show up at moved y-postion. Apparently adding the height of top window border to y-Position (approximately 20 pixel). Means using the Tab key 10 times to show tools window after hiding, moves the palettes by 200 pixel downwards. If you have the palettes sized to screen height (like me) more and more tools won't be accessible until you put the tools window back manually to the right position.

Thats on Mac OSX 10.5.8 and latest XQuarz 2.4.0. and Gimp 2.6.7
But it also happend on Mac OSX 10.5.8 with gimp 2.6.6 and Xquartz 2.2.1.

Window gravity has been overhauled in recent X11 updates and is correct. They probably don't handle window gravity correctly for their utility windows.
