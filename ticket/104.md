active tcl (8.4.19) bwidget combo box does not work well with Mac X11
=====================================================================


active tcl bwidget combo boxes support drop-down menus. First click gets the drop-down correctly, but subsequent clicks do not (button depresses, but no menu appears). Same code/app works on Linux.

Using 8.4.19 of active tcl

I just maintain the X server... you should report this issue to tk.
