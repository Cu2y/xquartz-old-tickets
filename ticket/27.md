Alt is screwy
=============


What I'm noticing with the X11-2.1.0.pkg version installed is that the left alt/option key is seen by xev as the right alt/option key but software mapped to the left alt key. The right alt/option key is seen as the right alt, but software mapped to the left alt key.

    In Tiger's X11, the left alt was keycode 66 and the right alt was keycode 69 as I'd expect.
    Here is xev with the left alt:
    KeyPress event, serial 22, synthetic NO, window 0x600001,
       root 0x57, subw 0x0, time 77250, (42,123), root:(42,167),
       state 0x0, keycode 66 (keysym 0xff7e, Mode_switch), same_screen YES,
       XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XFilterEvent returns: False


    In Leopard with the 1.2a set of installs (installed by Jeremy's x11_update.sh script), the left alt again was keycode 66 and the right was 69 again as expected.
    Here is the xev output with the left alt:
    KeyPress event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x200001,
       root 0x3f, subw 0x0, time 2993881147, (53,94), root:(53,138),
       state 0x0, keycode 66 (keysym 0xff7e, Mode_switch), same_screen YES,
       XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XFilterEvent returns: False


    In Leopard with the X11-2.1.0.pkg installed and post-reboot, things are rather different.
    Here is the xev output with the left alt:
    KeyPress event, serial 24, synthetic NO, window 0x200001,
       root 0x3f, subw 0x0, time 3126321031, (101,88), root:(101,132),
       state 0x0, keycode 69 (keysym 0xff7e, Mode_switch), same_screen YES,
       XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 66
       XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XFilterEvent returns: False

    Here is the xev output with the right alt:
    KeyPress event, serial 27, synthetic NO, window 0x200001,
       root 0x3f, subw 0x0, time 3126373406, (52,84), root:(52,128),
       state 0x0, keycode 69 (keysym 0xff7e, Mode_switch), same_screen YES,
       XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 66
       XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
       XFilterEvent returns: False

I don't want to ship an X11.pkg without this fixed... marking blocker

I reverted back to the old way which is working now.
