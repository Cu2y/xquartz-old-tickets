Phantoms show up of minimized windows in a transient-for relationship
=====================================================================


Tested with XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta4 (xorg-server 1.12.0.901).

Using Wine, launch Notepad. In Notepad, select Search &gt; Search. Minimize the main Notepad window. Click the XQuartz icon in the Dock.

A phantom image of the Notepad window will appear. It will not genie up from the Dock, it will just pop in. The Dock still shows the minimized window. The phantom of the Notepad window is entirely non-interactive. It can't be moved or anything.

Click on the minimized window in the Dock. The phantom of the Notepad window will vanish and the real window will genie up from the Dock. This real window will be properly interactive.

This only seems to happen for windows in a transient-for relationship. If the Search window is not open, Notepad stays properly minimized with no phantom.

I believe that this is a bug in libXplugin. It affects CrossOver, too, and the X server code is wildly different between CrossOver and XQuartz. Also, it doesn't seem to be in quartz-wm. Debug logging shows no quartz-wm activity between when Notepad has finished minimizing and when the phantom appears.

What OS Version are you seeing this on?

Is this a regression?

You say this affects Crossover and 2.7.2\_beta4, but AIUI, Crossover will use the host-provided Xplugin from /usr/lib rather than the XQuartz-provided one in /opt/X11/lib. Are you replacing the host's libXplugin to get Crossover to test the one from XQuartz, or are you seeing this with the Apple-provided Xplugin as well?

Do you see this when you have only \*one\* quartz-wm process running on your system?

I'll try to test this out this week.

Screening for 2.7.3 unless this turns out to be a regression.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/563#comment:1):

> What OS Version are you seeing this on?

10.7.3

> Is this a regression?

It seems to be. It doesn't happen in 10.6.8.

> You say this affects Crossover and 2.7.2\_beta4, but AIUI, Crossover will use the host-provided Xplugin from /usr/lib rather than the XQuartz-provided one in /opt/X11/lib.

I am seeing it with the Apple-provided libXplugin, as well. (I suppose I should file / should have filed a Radar.)

> Do you see this when you have only \*one\* quartz-wm process running on your system?

Yes. Most of my testing was with only one or the other of XQuartz and CrossOver running, not both simultaneously.

> I'll try to test this out this week.

Thanks.

> Screening for 2.7.3 unless this turns out to be a regression.

Yeah, I don't suspect recent XQuartz itself, so no need to delay releases.

(P.S. Sorry for the slow replay. Does Trac really not send me emails about replies to my tickets if I don't specifically CC myself?!?)

Just as additional info: I have tested with Apple's X11.app on 10.6.8 and 10.7.3. The bug happens on 10.7.3 and doesn't on 10.6.8.

Thanks. I've got a few higher priority issues that I needed to look at this week instead, but this is on my list for 2.7.3. I have some ideas about what it might be related to, but it's rather non-trivial =/

Is this still an issue for you on 10.8.2? Dock interaction is a bit hacky, but tracing through the code, this looks like it should be working due to a workaround I added for a Dock bug. Make sure you're using a quartz-wm that uses the dock support from libXplugin.

(or whatever binary is in current quartz-wm git)
