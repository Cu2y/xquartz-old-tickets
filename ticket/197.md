glXGetFBConfig() causes application to crash
============================================


Bug observed with Xquartz 2.3.2\_rc1.

This is a blocker because there is no way for an application to figure out that it is running with a buggy X11 server. None of output of the xdpyinfo or glxinfo programs uniquely identify the server as Xquartz 2.3.2. Until it is fixed, it would be better for the X11 server to not advertise that it supports the GLX\_SGIX\_fbconfig extension. To duplicate this bug, download the Mac X11 version of UCSF Chimera, <http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/>, and try to run it. This might be related to ticket [\#⁠122](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/122).

Ok, then this will be fixed in rc2. Please test rc2 when it's released and reopen this issue if there is still a problem.
