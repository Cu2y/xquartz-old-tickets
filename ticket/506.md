RandR fullscreen has title bar
==============================


RandR fullscreen is reserving the space for a title bar. The area is black, it does not show the title bar, but it causes the bottom of the app to be clipped off. The app I'm trying to run is Wine.

This was fixed a while ago. Please use the XQuartz 2.7.0 beta1. If it's not fixed there, use beta2 when it comes out.
