Snow Leopard X11 (2.3.4) doesn't pass geometry information for non-standard windows
===================================================================================


I just upgraded to Snow Leopard (late to the party, I know). The new X11 included a pretty annoying bug: it doesn't pass the correct geometry information to new ssh sessions.

For example, I use the following command every day to open a window into my linux box:

xterm -sb -leftbar -bg lightgoldenrod -fg black -geometry 120x50+40+40 -e ssh -2 -Y hostname-redacted.com &

Under Leopard, this correctly generated a 120x50 session. Under Snow Leopard, however, the geometry information never makes it to the remote machine, which thinks it's an 80x25 session instead of a 120x50 session.

There is also weirdness with reattaching 'screen' sessions -- they always default to 80x25.

I have found discussion of this problem in a few places:

<http://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2009/Aug/msg00127.html>

<http://superuser.com/questions/31575/gnu-screen-fails-to-resize-with-snow-leopard-xterm>

But no solutions have been posted. I searched x11-users and the bug reports here but found nothing.

Given how much I use X11, I may have to downgrade back to Leopard, which would be a terrible sadness.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Sarah

This is not an X11 bug. Please report it at <http://bugreport.apple.com>

Are you sure? It turns out I get this on x11 xterms into my own computer, not just remote sessions. If I open a new xterm which is bigger than 80x25, and then type "pico foo", I get the following:

Which is obviously wrong! Before Snow Leopard, I would get a pico session that correctly took up the whole window.

If this is an Apple bug and not an X11 bug, it may go uncaught as I tried to use the bug reporter you note above and was told I didn't have access to it.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Sarah.

Yes, I am certain it is not an X11 bug.

The same binaries run on Leopard do not exhibit this problem.

Search the xquartz-dev or x11-users mailing list for the workaround.
