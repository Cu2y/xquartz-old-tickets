PyMol flickers and crashes
==========================


Pymol (both an older version and the most recent one) installed with Fink flickers and crashes when the viewer's window is re-sized or moved. The machine will not respond for a few minutes (although the cursor can be moved), after that I can quit X11, but a shadow of the closed flickering window stays and disappears gradually after a few minutes. The problem appeared after I updated X11 to 2.5.0 (previous installed version was about 2 years old). OS X 10.5.8.

-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*

What version were you using before? I wonder if this is a stereo issue. Can you update to SnowLeopard?

What is the backtrace of the crash?

What version?- This is not going to be very helpful: I don't know, is was about two years old, and now it's gone.
I don't think it is a stereo issue: I don't use stereo, plus the first symptoms appear when I just start PyMol. Actually, here is something potentially helpful. When I updated OS X to 10.5.8 from whatever I had before (when PyMol worked flawlessly), PyMol wouldn't work at all: upon PyMol start, I would see the normal command window, but the window that was supposed to show structures would just flicker constantly. Interestingly, the flickering would go away if I position the window at a border of the screen, so just a third or so shows. Next thing I did was installing 2.5.1 from here and the newest version of PyMol from Fink. I didn't test PyMol in the middle of this update. New PyMol plus Xquartz 2.5.1 helped somewhat: now when I start PyMol the viewer's window flickers for a second or so, then everything seems normal until I try to resize or move the viewer's window. Actually, VERY slow motions are usually OK, but if I move/resize the window at a normal rate, I get the flickering that I described. The only way out of this is to wait until the system starts responding and kill X11.
Snow Leopard: On another machine, which runs 10.6.3 with Xquartz 2.5.1, the newest version of PyMol runs just fine, without any flickering at any moment.

What do you mean by 2.5.1? That version does not exist. What video card do you have?

2.5.0, sorry: it's late... I have NVIDIA Quadro FX4500 512MB.

Yeah, this is a graphics driver issue that should be fixed in SL.
