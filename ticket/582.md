impossible to avoid information about update
============================================


We want to use XQuarz in our classrooms with Gimp 2.8. In XQuartz 2.7.1, we can say not to be informed of the next release. **But it would be very important in our case (students in classrooms) to avoid all new information about releases, even 2.7.3 or 2.7.4**. We make one computer configuration in june which will be used all the next school year and we don't want that students see a window for an possible update.

Thanks

Christian

Once you set SUEnableAutomaticChecks to false, it doesn't check automatically ...
