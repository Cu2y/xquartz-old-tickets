control key fails to work over Screen Sharing in emacs 22 (fink, 10.5.6)
========================================================================


Just upgraded to 2.3.1 and Leopard 10.5.6. Now, when I access the Mac via Screen Sharing (from another 10.5.6 Mac), the control key is no longer recognized in X Emacs (source compilation from fink - can't get the binary, not sure why). When I type cntrl-f, the character "f" appears in my buffer. This is new behavior, but I don't know whether it's due to 10.5.6 or 2.3.1. I suspect the latter, because I have two versions of Screen Sharing (the current one, and an older one which does screen locking) and both manifest the problem.

-   **Milestone** set to *SnowLeopard*

Moving to SnowLeopard milestone since this is a bug outside of X11 (we did things differently before, and the fix to the locked-modifier-key-state bug resulted in this issue cropping up)

-   **Milestone** changed from *SnowLeopard* to *2.3.2*

I'm going to try coming up with a workaround hack for this

There is a workaround for this bug in 2.3.2\_rc5
