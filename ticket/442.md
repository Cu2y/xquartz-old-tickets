XRandR 2.6.0\_alpha2: after change resolution by app it stays until quit of XQuartz
===================================================================================


I've:

-   run game through wine
-   it was fullscreen, 1024x768
-   it succesfully changed resolution of screen (from 1440x900 to 1024x768); great job with finally working XRandR!
-   after quit of application XQuartz stayed in fullscreen mode in 1024x768 and whole my desktop was 1024x768
-   quiting of XQuartz set my resolution back to native

Quiting of application should quite fullscreen mode of XQuartz and change back resolution to native.
Hope you can fix it before final. :)

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

The application is supposed to restore the resolution when it quits. If it crashes, this won't happen, so you can hit cmd-opt-a to force it back to default.
