Will not allow me to install the latest update
==============================================


when updating to the latest version from ver. 1.2.5 and running snow leopard I get the message that this install is for leopard only "this update install is designed for OSX Leopard only" with the close button. When i close the message to install the update the entire application closes and therefore can't install????

That is correct. Use the version included with SnowLeopard, wait for 2.5.0 to be released, or use the betas.
