Launchpad search bar broken after XQuartz installed
===================================================


Hi, just tried XQuartz for the first time and it seems to work nicely except that it breaks my "Launchpad" search bar.
Procedure was: I installed XQuartz, then logged out and back in; then tried to search for an app using Launchpad and discovered that I could not type in the search bar, and it was also impossible to select the search bar by clicking it. There might be something unusual about the Launchpad program in general, as I noticed the mouse cursor seems to change in accordance with whatever program is opened in the background (even when it's working normally). But clicking the search bar and/or typing text definitely works again now that I disabled XQuartz...

The problem is pretty annoying so I will have to disable XQuartz until it's fixed.

Using XQuartz 2.7.5 on OSX 10.9.2

Hope this helps.

What do you mean "disabled XQuartz"?

In any event. We have nothing to do with Launchpad, and there's no way we can affect it.

By "disabled" I meant disabling auto-start / automatic setting of the DISPLAY variable by running
launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist

Seems that if I start XQuartz manually, there is no problem.
So either I'm going mad or perhaps something else in the system reacts strangely to having the DISPLAY environment set?
I can try to reproduce the problem again & if I can't, then just forget about it.

Yeah... maybe LaunchPad is trying to use X11 if DISPLAY is set ... ? Either way, I suggest you ask them ;)
