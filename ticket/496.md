Focus stealing should be configurable (and disabled by default)
===============================================================


Focus stealing is distracting an dangerous. Applications should never do it. Since the window manager can just discard API requests of applications wanting to do this, this should be a feature of XQuartz. User should be able to enable Focus stealing if they want this, the default should be a jumping icon or a star next to it (like for Mail.app)

Yeah, we've supported that for as long as I can remember. Check out your preferences, "Focus on New Windows" or similar.
