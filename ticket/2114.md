OpenSUSE Client 13.2 Vim Extraneous Lines Displayed, ESC Key Ignored
====================================================================


I am running XQuart 2.7.7 on a Mac OS X 10.8.5 system. I run an xterm on the Mac and ssh into my OpenSUSE 13.2 client machine at work.

I then edit a file using Vim 7.4.461 and notice that extraneous lines appear when I do an "o" or "O" command to insert a blank line. The extraneous lines come from directly above or below where I intend to insert the blank.

When I do an "i" to insert text, the "-- INSERT --" message is displayed in the lower left corner by Vim as expected. However, an ESC key then does not cause that message to be removed. It's as if the ESC key is being ignored.

When running an older Vim 7.3.315 this problems do not occur. But there are many differences between the newer version Vim 7.4.461 and older version 7.3.315. They have been built with substantially different options.

The older Vim is intended for servers, while the newer Vim is apparently intended for clients and supports the clipboard, xterm\_clipboard, and X11 options. I believe these options allow easy cutting and pasting to other applications and are not enabled on the older server Vim 7.3.315.

I don't know if this problem is due to a bug in XQuart on Mac OS X, a bug in X11 on my OpenSUSE system, or a bug in Vim. I suspect it is an XQuart bug because I am unable to reproduce this problem logging-in from other Linux variants to my OpenSUSE system at work.

Obviously I meant XQuartz not XQuart!

Note that the extraneous lines appear on the xterm display, but are not actually included in the edited file.

Odd, can you try using xinput and xev to figure out what events are being sent and where this is going wrong?

I verified that the OpenSUSE vi command still has the same extraneous line problem even after months of maintenance has been applied to my system.

I use xterm on my iMac to connect to my Linux OpenSUSE machine and execute vi to edit a file on the Linux system. The edit session displayed on the iMac shows the extraneous lines when I do an insert of a line.

I have installed the xinput and xev commands on my Linux machine. How should I use them to get the needed debug information?

Thanks.

Run them and see what events are being sent. Confirm if they make sense. Compare the event stream in the broken xquartz case with the working non-xquartz case to see what the difference is.

This problem involves XQuartz X11 only; there is no non-XQuartz X11 involved. The only difference between the working case and the failing case is the release of the vi editor that is run on the remote OpenSUSE machine.

I start an xterm on the iMac XQuartz machine, login to the remote Linux machine, and run the two versions of vi that display in the XQuartz xterm window on the iMac. I am confused about where I should run the xinput and xev commands. Should they be run on the local iMac running XQuartz or the remote Linux X11 server machine?

I ran xinput on the local iMac and got this:

â¡ Virtual core pointer id=2 \[master pointer (3)\]
â â³ Virtual core XTEST pointer id=4 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ xquartz virtual pointer id=6 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ pen id=8 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ cursor id=9 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ eraser id=10 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â£ Virtual core keyboard id=3 \[master keyboard (2)\]

> â³ Virtual core XTEST keyboard id=5 \[slave keyboard (3)\]
> â³ xquartz virtual keyboard id=7 \[slave keyboard (3)\]

And then ran it on the remote Linux machine and got this:

â¡ Virtual core pointer id=2 \[master pointer (3)\]
â â³ Virtual core XTEST pointer id=4 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ xquartz virtual pointer id=6 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ pen id=8 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ cursor id=9 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â â³ eraser id=10 \[slave pointer (2)\]
â£ Virtual core keyboard id=3 \[master keyboard (2)\]

> â³ Virtual core XTEST keyboard id=5 \[slave keyboard (3)\]
> â³ xquartz virtual keyboard id=7 \[slave keyboard (3)\]

I tried running xev on both the local iMac and remote Linux machines and did not get any events logged when I ran the vi edit sessions. This is the command that I ran both locally and remotely:

xev -id 0xa0000d

I appreciate the help and can provide you with the debugging information you need, but I am struggling to understand exactly how to collect it.

You said, " I suspect it is an XQuart bug because I am unable to reproduce this problem logging-in from other Linux variants to my OpenSUSE system at work."

That is the non-XQuartz case that I am interested in.

It doesn't matter. You just need them connected to your XQuartz server.

That just lists the devices. That's not what is interesting. You should be checking the event stream. For example, run 'xinput test 7' to see the events.

I ran this xinput command on my iMac running XQuartz:

xinput --test-xi2 --root

and saw the many KeyPress and KeyRelease events for the edit sessions. One session with the vi that is OK, and the other session with a vi that displays the extraneous line in the xterm window.

I saw no events in either trace that showed the data being displayed back to the xterm session; all I saw were numerous key events such as these:

EVENT type 2 (KeyPress)

> device: 7 (7)
> detail: 65
> flags:
> root: 492.66/584.21
> event: 492.66/584.21

> group: locked 0 latched 0 base 0 effective: 0
> valuators:
> windows: root 0x201 event 0x201 child 0x400007

EVENT type 14 (RawKeyRelease)

> detail: 65

EVENT type 3 (KeyRelease)

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
