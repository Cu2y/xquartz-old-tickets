Quit Confirmation Fails iMac Shutdown
=====================================


Hi,

When Quartz is running, auto-shutdown configuration on the iMac fails, due to the Quartz "Do you really want to quit X11?" confirm window, which causes shutdown to hang and then give up.

This kind of confirm is typical for programs that have unsaved work at the time of a shutdown, e.g. when a word processing file has unsaved text updates. I don't think that kind of confirm scenario is analogous to running X11 terminals, or the server itself. In any case, I'd propose that Quartz add a configuration that enables the user to turn off this confirm window.

You may consider this design intent rather than a bug, but I can't find a way to report this issue other than as a bug.

IF there already is a way to accomplish this, please let me know. I don't see such a configuration in the Preferences interface.

Thanks.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *behaves correctly*

This is correct behavior. There is no way for the server to know if the client windows have unsaved work, so we don't want to close them without a prompt.

If you have no X11 windows, you won't get a prompt.

Even though it's 'correct behaviour', it might have been useful to clarify that the 'confirm quit' confirmation dialog can in fact be suppressed easily. This is an issue that has bugged me as well for some time.

The solution is as follows: in a terminal window, type

    defaults write -app XQuartz no_quit_alert true

Yep, it's right there in the man page along with other options ;) See 'man Xquartz'
