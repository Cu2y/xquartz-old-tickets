Adding "XAuthLocation" line to sshd\_config breaks configs with "Match"
=======================================================================


My /etc/sshd\_config contains a number of "Match" blocks grouped at the end (for defining sftp clients). They have to be at the end because the syntax for "Match" is that it begins a block that continues until another "Match" directive or until end-of-file.

The "XAuthLocation" line that was appended to my sshd\_config by the XQuartz installer broke ssh on my system because the line was considered to be part of the last "Match" block, and that directive is not allowed there:

fatal: /etc/sshd\_config line 150: Directive 'XAuthLocation' is not allowed within a Match block

If this has to be added as part of installation then it has to be added somewhere other than at the end, or else the installer has to be smarter and take "Match" into account.

I fixed it on my system by manually moving the line to precede the Match blocks.
