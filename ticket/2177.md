iconifying main window doesn't iconify the dependent windows
============================================================


I have an application that opens multiple windows from pull down menus in the main window. In X11 on Solaris and Linux when I iconify the main window all the other windows from the application get iconified also. Under X-quartz only the main window gets iconified. Is there a way to get all the windows to iconify together.

Sorry to bother you, but could you please file this instead at <https://github.com/jeremyhu/quartz-wm/issues/new> and then close this ticket?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
