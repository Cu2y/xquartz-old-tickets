AIGLX crashes when closing Gaussview
====================================


X11 crashes when I do one of the following in the program Gaussview (www.gaussian.com):

-   Attempt to exit the program using File -&gt; Exit
-   Attempt to close the last remaining molecule window (which may trigger the same routines as File -&gt; Exit)

I am running Gaussview over ssh from a remote machine, forwarding to my mac.

Details of crash: Exits with the following error in Console.app:

19/5/09 6:09:18 p.m. \[0x0-0x3e03e\].org.x.X11\[98927\] xp\_destroy\_surface: assertion failed: s != ((void \*)0)

19/5/09 6:09:22 p.m. org.x.startx\[98955\] /usr/X11/bin/xinit: connection to X server lost.

A crash log is attached for further information. The crash log suggests that a Kernel Protection Failure is responsible.

How reproducible: Always. The only time this crash has not occurred was the first time I ran X11 after installing the FVWM window manager. After this first time, it returned to business as usual.

Steps I've taken in an attempt to solve:

-   Install Xquartz 2.3.3.2 instead of Apple's default X11 (no effect)
-   Use ssh -X instead of ssh -Y when opening the connection to the remote host (no effect)
-   Use the FVWM window manager instead of Xquartz Window Manager (no effect, except on the very first time, as mentioned above)

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Summary** changed from *X11 crashes when closing Gaussview* to *AIGLX crashes when closing Gaussview*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.0*

That's a bug with our AIGLX code. As a workaround, don't use indirect GLX... run the application locally.

I'll try to get this working in 2.4.0

Can you please try 1.5.3-apple7 and let me know if it's still happening in that server?

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/267#comment:2):

Hi Jeremy,

Sorry I've taken so long to respond. I didn't expect anything here until 2.4.0 was released, so I didn't check back.

I have just downloaded and installed 2.4.0\_rc2, which, I'm told, is functionally equivalent to xorg-server 1.5.3-apple14. I guess that is later than apple7.

But I'm still getting crashes as before.

I can't run the application locally, owing to our licensing arrangements. We only have access to the Linux version of the software. So I'm stuck with either indirect GLX or no GLX at all, I guess.

Unless there's something else I could try?

I emailed the developers of gaussview about this last week, and they said that they have not seen this problem. I suggest you contact them and mention this bug report. Here's the original mail and response I got from them:

      Jeremy,

       I will keep my eyes open but to date we have not gotten reports
    of a problem like this.

    Hello,

    We have received a series of crash reports from users who report that

    I would like to track down this bug, but I cannot reproduce the
    problem.  The problem is reported to occur in X11.app 2.1.6 (which is
    shipped in 10.5.7 and 10.5.8).  Have you seen this in any of your
    testing?  Have you been able to reproduce the problem in 2.3.3.2 or
    2.4.0-rc2?  Can you help me reproduce the problem, so I can fix X11.app?

    Thanks,
    Jeremy

OK, I've sent Douglas an email, and we'll see what turns up. Thanks for your help.

I got this response from the helpdesk:

================================

Dr. Roberts,

Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we are aware of this problem with the X11 software distributed with OS X 10.5.X. We first observed this with the initial X11 software distributed with OS X 10.5 and we hoped that the subsequent updates would take care of it but it has not been the case. The GaussView developers are investigating whether there is anything that can be done on their side or not. GaussView is tested and supported in all the platforms for which is distributed, however, we cannot guarantee that it would be compatible with all possible softwares for remote visualization. I apologize for the inconvenience. My Mac specialist is out of the office today, but I will check with him on the status of this issue with GaussView 5.

Regards,

Gary W. Trucks, Ph.D.
Gaussian, Inc.

Another response from the helpdesk. They say that a workaround is available, using MesaGL instead of OpenGL. I have tried this and it works on at least some machines.

I'm not sure whether that means this bug is "fixed" or not. I guess that depends on whether it's a problem with the OpenGL client implementation in XQuartz, or the OpenGL server implementation in Linux; or maybe it's some other component of Linux or the Mac OS.

Your thoughts?

================================

Dr. Roberts,

Using the Apple's X11 application from Mac OS X 10.5.x to display a remote session of GaussView (e.g. running on Linux) shows a problem that cause the X11 application to crash. This is likely a OpenGL library issue between server and client.

A workaround for this problem is to use MESA GL libraries instead of OpenGL libraries. In your Linux machine (the Linux machine needs to have MESA libraries installed), you will need to set the following environment variable before running GaussView:

setenv USE\_MESAGL 1 (if you use csh or tcsh shells)

or

export USE\_MESAGL=1 (if you use bash shell)

Note that GaussView is tested and supported in all the platforms for which is distributed, that is when running it locally on the same computer where it is installed. We cannot guarantee for GaussView to be compatible with all possible softwares for remote visualization and the multiple possible combinations of host and remote operating systems.

Please, let me know if you have any problems,

MesaGL is an implementation of OpenGL, so their wording is actually incorrect. In fact, on Linux systems, you are most likely using MesaGL anyways. The only reason you wouldn't be is if you are using nVidia's or ATI's closed source drivers. My guess is that they force using swrast as the DRI driver when you set USE\_MESAGL=1 ... this is bad design on their part since it actually duplicates the effect of an already-existing environment variable (LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_SOFTWARE).

What libGL do you have on your linux machine? Can you try setting "LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_SOFTWARE=1" instead of "USE\_MESAGL=1" ...

Unfortunately, their "workaround" is going to give you horrible performance since it results in software rendering rather than accelerated rendering...

*ben@…* commented *[on Aug 12, 2009](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/267#comment:10 "August 12, 2009 at 11:54 AM PDT")*

The implementation of GaussView as provided by Gaussian uses a shell script to launch the executable. This shell script opens with "csh -f", which, I understand, forces environment variables to be ignored in favour of a "default" setting.

I tried modifying this shell script, replacing references to "USE\_MESAGL" to "LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_SOFTWARE". This caused the original problem to reappear. It seems that, for whatever reason, the environment variable must be called USE\_MESAGL. Why is a bit of a mystery to me.

As regards horrible performance, I agree that it will most likely be slower than it would be if accelerated rendering could be used. But better slow performance than no performance (and danger to other programs), at least until the accelerated indirect rendering can be fixed.

We have the same problem on our new macs when running GV4 remotely on an ia64 machine. I wanted to make a quick comment. It is my understanding that GaussView is written by semichem and it is a pruned down version of the ampac GUI so, for bug problems, I have always contacted semichem directly.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *wontfix*

Due to insufficient information and the lack of a reproducible test case that I can test with, this bug will not be fixed. Gaussian has requested that anyone experiencing this issue contact them.
