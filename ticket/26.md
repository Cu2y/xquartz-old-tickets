Fink unable to recognise the updated package instalation
========================================================


After installing the latest unofficial package on top of the official Apple release, I get the following error with Fink:
could not determine XFree86 version number

On investigating, it looks like Fink is unable to detect that X11 is actually installed and running. I have posted it on the Fink-devel list as well.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

We've been discussing this in the xquartz-dev forum and have proposed a few solutions on how fink can fix this problem. They've been using hacks to find the version in the past (grepping man pages, using unofficial detection, etc). They now have a \*real\* way to detect the version using pkg-config, so that is hopefully what they'll do.

Sit tight, and hopefully they'll have a robust fix soon.
