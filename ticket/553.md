long xauth generate timeout crashes server
==========================================


Running "ssh -o 'ForwardX11Timeout 24d21h' -X somehost somecommand..." crashes the XQuartz server for me with an assertion failure:

Assertion failed: (pAuth-&gt;timer == timer), function SecurityAuthorizationExpired, file security.c, line 313.

A timeout of 24d20h doesn't cause the problem.

From poking around on the net, it looks like it's a known problem reproducible with "xauth generate" with a long timeout, causing some sort of failure, but I kept running into a restricted-access bug report elsewhere.

I should be able to give a month, or a year, or several, for the timeout value. If some protocol bug prevents specification of a timeout that long, either a useful message should be presented or the timeout should be capped at the maximum, or both.

The crashing thread:

We're just doing what upstream has done. I think this was fixed by X.org. Please try 2.7.7\_beta1. If it's still an issue there, please file a bug at freedesktop.org
