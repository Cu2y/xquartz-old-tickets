There is a bug with the software altair hyperworks 11 and OS 10.8.2
===================================================================


After installing the Operation System Update 10.8.2 the software altair hyperworks does not work with xquartz 2.7.3. The GUI is not loading finally. Also the GUI can not be controlled by the user. I returned to OS 10.8.1 and then the application works fine. I think, that there are some problems with the rights of xquartz 2.7.3 in OS 10.8.2. How can I help you to fix this problem? Which log do you need and where do I find it?

Does this software use GLX? If so, please try 2.7.4.
