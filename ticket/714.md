2.7.4 dmg not recognised
========================


Hi, 2.7.4 dog can not be opened, the image is not recognised. This prevents the use of X11 (installed from MacPorts, then). This is not a crash, but prevents the system use.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

1) You probably have an incomplete download. Try again.

2) This in no way impacts your use of X11 on MacPorts.
