A precision with issue with hidden windows (Yosemite and latest version of XQuartz)
===================================================================================


I use Yosemite latest version (10.10.1) and XQuartz 2.7.7. I noticed that the "invisble X11 window" bug is now very subtle : lauching for instance Xemacs on my mac is giving a well defined X11 window properly defined on the screen that i can move back and forth between screens. Nevertheless, when connected to a external unix system via ssh, the X11 window is not properly setup and is not visible on the screen but still there doing F3....

Sorry, I don't understand what is being reported. Can you please clarify with videos or screenshots? What is the "invisible X11 window" bug?

I had a similar problem and found the solution. I am using Terminator to open multiple windows that connect by ssh to different remote systems. I used terminator on Yosemite 10.10.1, Quartz 2.7.7. Terminator was installed via Fink.

Inside the preference window, one can configure the command to execute when open the window. I wrote ssh user@machine. The problem is that you need to force pseudo-tty allocation. by typing ssh -t user@machine. When is not done in that way, the window remains hidden and only visible when you press the Mission Control button (F3). The problem should be solved by adding -t option in ssh.

Thank you !
It turns out that my issue was really in the ssh config : I used to do ssh -Y mylogin@server but this makes the issue with ou wihtout the "-t" option that you quote.
I figured out that doing : ssh -X mylogin@server solves the problem !

I don't know what changed between my old system (Snow Leopard, Build in X11 of MacOS) where my previous command was fine
and now (Yosemite, XQuartz) the problem is solved for me.
Thanks !
