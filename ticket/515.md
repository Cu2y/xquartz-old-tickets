Keyboard messed up with NX client
=================================


Running Apple-supplied X11 server, version XQuartz 2.3.6 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple56). I use Nomachine NX client 3.5.0-7 to connect to a local Ubuntu linux Lucid (10.4) machine.

I then install XQuartz 2.6.3 downloaded from this site. The result is that they keyboard has gone totally haywire. Pressing Enter outputs j, keyboard numbers output letters below them, 1 being e, 2 being r, 3 being t and so on. Left Shift has turned into an alt key and Tab outputs the letter b.

Local Xterm under the new XQuartz works as expected. Opening manually (by double-clicking the icon in Applications/Utilities folder) the original X11, local Xterm also works as expected. Being unable to uninstall XQuartz 2.6.3 now and try the Apple's original X11, I am unable to cross-check the issue. Even if original X11 is running, opening a connection with NX client launches the new XQuartz.

launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist did nothing to stop the 2.6.3 version from starting. I rebooted the machine, then tried the command again, and also

sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macosforge.xquartz.privileged\_startx.plist

and logged out after that, but that didn't help either. Will next proceed to delete 2.6.3 from my machine, as instructed in X11-UsersFAQ.

After deleting 2.6.3 and rebooting, NX client starts Apple's X11 and keyboard inside the remote Ubuntu machine is back to normal.

Just a remark: all launchctl commands were given with sudo. I saw I omitted it from the earlier comment. launchctl puts out nothing on success and gives an error if the command is repeated. This works as a verification that the first command was successful, AFAIK.

Yeah, NX seems to be doing something wrong.
