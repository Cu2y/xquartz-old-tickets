Xvfb from 2.7.2 missing strndup on Snow Leopard
===============================================


Attempting to run Xvfb from Xquartz 2.7.2 on 10.6.8 I get:

    $ uname -r
    10.8.0
    $ ls -l /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  2791840 Jun  1 16:15 /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb
    $ /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb :2
    dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _strndup
      Referenced from: /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb
      Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib

    dyld: Symbol not found: _strndup
      Referenced from: /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb
      Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib

    Trace/BPT trap

<http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/xquartz-changes/2011-November/001351.html> indicates that strndup should always be included for cases where xquartz is compiiled on 10.7 but targets 10.6.

Well that just fixed XQuartz. I didn't realize the Xvfb (and maybe other DDXs) were affected as well.

As a workaround, just install 2.7.1, backup /opt/X11/bin/Xvfb, install 2.7.2, then replace its Xvfb with the old one.

This will be fixed in the first rc of 2.7.3

Any chance Xnest is also affected? Getting the below after upgrade to 2.7.3 rc2

    $ Xnest :9 -query 192.168.1.102
    _XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0,directory /tmp/.X11-unix will not be created.

Yeah, sorry... there was a problem with the fix in 2.7.3\_rc2. It will be fixed in 2.7.3.
