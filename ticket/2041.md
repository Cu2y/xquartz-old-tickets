X forwarding fails with "Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key"
========================================================


I upgraded to the latest beta: 2.7.8\_beta1 - 2014.08.18 an suddenly all X forwarding fails with an invalid magic cookie error.

Reinstalling 2.7.7 made the issue go away again. So this may be a bit of an important issue that needs resolving before the next release.

I used OS X 10.10 GM1 when trying this.

The only difference between 2.7.7 and 2.7.8\_beta1 was the bump to a newer xorg-server version (and related font package updates). Xauth didn't change at all. Can you please try again? I've had no other reports like this and can't see how it would be possible.
