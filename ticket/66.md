Xquartz 2.1.4 does not take into account preference no\_quit\_alert
===================================================================


Despite setting defaults write org.x.X11 no\_quit\_alert -boolean false to enable the message "Are you sure to quit X11?", Xquartz quits without asking. The feature is there even if there are X windows open.
