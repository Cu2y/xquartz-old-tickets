copy buffer from x11 does not always update in Mac OS X apps
============================================================


Quite often, if I select text and press cmd-c in X11, and then go to a Mac OS X app and do cmd-V to paste, the item that I copied is not pasted-- but rather the item that was previously in the buffer.

It seems that this happens maybe every 3-4 times of doing copy/paste.

I have noticed failure to paste the expected data as well in recent beta/rc releases. It seems to be related to the amount of text copied --- a line or less usually works, ten or more lines seldom does. I think also that some source apps may be worse than others; I've had a lot of problems trying to copy from PDFs in Preview, in particular.

I have all pasteboard prefs enabled except the last one (update pasteboard immediately)

... although what I've had trouble with is pasting from OSX apps to X11 ones, the opposite of what Patrick said, so maybe it's a different bug?

-   **Version** set to *2.4.0 (xserver-1.5)*
-   **Priority** changed from *minor* to *major*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*

I think they may be related in that there's likely a bug in the async delivery of the data and timestamping ...

Can you try 2.6.2? There was a pbproxy fix that went into it, and this issue may have been the same root cause.

Hmm... this was reported with the Leopard version, so it is probably not the same root cause as the issue fixed in 2.6.2 which was an LP64 issue.

No response from reporter. I'm unable to reproduce this on my own. Without help reproducing, I can't hope to address this. Closing.
