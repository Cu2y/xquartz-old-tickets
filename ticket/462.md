Disable screen saver hot corners when switching to full screen
==============================================================


If an X11 application switches to full screen (e.g., wine) and "hot corners" are defined for the screen saver in System Preferences -&gt; Desktop & Screen Saver, these hot corners remain active.

The result is that the screen saver kicks in whenever the mouse cursor is moved into one of those hot corners while using such a full screen app, which is undesirable.

Are you seeing this when the cursor is really in that location, or when the cursor is hidden and the mouse is behaving like a game controller (ie moving your character rather than a cursor)?

I see this when cursor is in location when running games using Wine. Didn't tried a game that uses mouse as a controller recently but I don't remember anything like that happening in the past.
BTW Any hot corners action is trigered not just screen saver, Expose, Dashboard, turning off screen, etc. It's not something really serious but for sure it will make full screen experience much better if hot corners will be disabled in full screen mode.
Using XQuartz 2.7.5\_rc1.

I forgot to mention that it happens only when you turned off and then turned back on full screen mode. (Switching to other window and back or similar behaviour).

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
