Intermittent failure of copy paste functions within X11 and to Cocoa
====================================================================


I am experiencing a strange failure that happens every so often where copy paste just stops working. I've yet to discover a way to immediately reproduce this, but it does happen about once per day for me (I use X quite a lot for Eclipse and Intellij on linux machines accessed used ssh -X).

Version is 2.7.5rc1
OSX 10.8.2

Probably [\#⁠519](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/519) ... reproduction steps would be nice...
