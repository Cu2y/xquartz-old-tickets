What do you mean by "Original X11" ? What version introduced the issue you have? Can you please explain, in words, what the issue is? I'm having difficulty loading the youtube video and will try tomorrow.

You marked this as a crash, so can you please attach the crash log?

The issue is that i cant continue to do my work in Siemens NX. It will not crash XQuartz.
Original is X11.app XQuartz 2.3.6 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple56).
You should see the video in original quality.

Ok, so there are MANY versions in between your working version and the reported broken one. Please narrow down the version that introduced the bug.
