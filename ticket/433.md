port 6000 locked by X11
=======================


On my mac-mini (system 10.5.8) the new version of X11 2.5.2 locks the port 6000 of my computer.
Then, remote UNIX servers cannot open windows on my Macintosh.
I came back to the old version (X11 2.5.0) and the port was reopened.
How to reopen the Port 6000 with the new X11 version...
