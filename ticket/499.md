Update Pasteboard when CLIPBOARD changes only works when XQuartz is active.
===========================================================================


I've been trying to get vim to use the OS X pasteboard lately. In an X11-enabled vim I can type "+Y to copy to CLIPBOARD, which XQuartz then syncs to the pasteboard.

But this only works if I'm in an xterm. I usually use vim from ITerm2 and then the pasteboard is not updated. $DISPLAY is set properly, if there's no X11 connection vim will just beep.

I'm guessing this is done explicitly as a safety matter, but I think that's not really needed. Please change it.

Just noticed that if I uncheck "Update PRIMARY when pasteboard changes" then it works.

No, disregard that last comment. It will update the pasteboard when I read CLIPBOARD from a separate program, eg. another vim process.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
