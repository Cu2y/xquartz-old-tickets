Graphics garbled
================


The graphics in the window are garbled. The same application works fine in MobaXTerm.

When comparing with MobaXTerm, are you using the exact same client (ie, are you sshing somewhere and displaying it on both MobaXTerm and XQuartz)? If you're comparing the app running on windows talking to XWin and running on a mac talking to XQuartz, there's not really much to go on here...
