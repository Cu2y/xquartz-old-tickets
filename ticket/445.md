/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers/gl.h:37: error: expected identifier or '(' before '/' token
===============================================================================================================


I am trying to compile a program called Xcrysden 1.5.21 in OSX 10.6.4 with Xquartz 2.5.3.
I get an error

/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers/gl.h:37: error: expected identifier or '(' before '/' token

Tried compilers: gcc (by apple) gcc-4.3 gcc-4.4 (macports) intel compiler

The compilation works in Linux X11 flavours.

The line you are referencing is a C99 comment. You are probably building with some strict C89 CFLAGS that don't like C99 comments.
