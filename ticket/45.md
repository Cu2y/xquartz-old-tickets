OpenGL stereo no longer works
=============================


Apple had stereo support in Tiger's X11.app, added in 1.1.3 update, but that functionality appears to be lost. Apple's instructions say to do "defaults write com.apple.x11 enable\_stereo -bool true" to get stereo visuals, but in Leopard, glxinfo still doesn't report any stereo visuals.

This seems to be symptomatic of Apple's poor support for OpenGL under X11, other capabilities that should be there, like destination alpha and multisampling when the graphics card supports them, are missing too. So while my immediate concern is to get stereo support back (so I don't have to tell people to downgrade to Tiger or reboot in Windows to use my application), it seems like it any such support would naturally include all of the possible OpenGL visuals the hardware supports.
