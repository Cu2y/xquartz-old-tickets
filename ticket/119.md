X does not respect selected keyboard layout
===========================================


I have my input method set to British. However, using shift-3 in X generates a \# symbol. In all other applications this generates a £ sign, and I have to use option-3 for the \#. What X does is what I would expect if I had the input set to US.

My bad - I'd lost my preference file and not reset it. Sorry.
