New icon for X11.app
====================


I've designed a new icon for X11. It's based on X.Org's own logo, which is IMO more pleasing and colorful than the current b&w icon.
So I suggest putting this into the app bundle replacing the current one.

I've put in under the MIT/X11 license, see <http://www.lisanet.de/pivot/entry.php?id=41#body>

This icon is worse than the existing icon in one way:

The existing x11.app icon contains 256x256 and 512x512 versions. This one maxes out at 128. The result is that it looks kind of icky if you're a crazy person with huge icons or a crazy person that uses the coverflow view in Finder.

If you have something scalable you generated this icon from, it would be nice to have one with high resolution versions.

I've just updated the icon. It now includes 512x512 and 256x256 versions.

It's is slightly modified too by adding some light to the "X" so that it should be more visible on dark backgrounds.
