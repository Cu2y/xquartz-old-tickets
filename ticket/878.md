X11 windows locked at the display they appeared first (OSX 10.9)
================================================================


With OSX 10.9 and multiple monitors once you open a window on monitor "1" you can't drag it to monitor "2" because it becomes transparent, and vice-versa.

I'm using XQuartz 2.7.5, and before the upgrade I was using 10.8.5 and the issue wasn't there. So it probably it has to do with OSX 10.9.

Sorry, I'm no X11 or programming guru... so I'm just reporting an issue that is affecting me, and may be affecting other people.

Not an XQuartz bug. This needs to be fixed by an OS update.
