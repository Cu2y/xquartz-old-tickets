XQuartz is looping on MAC OS X Mavericks
========================================


After upgrading from mountain lion to mavericks, I removed and re-installed Xquartz (2.7.7). Now when I start Xquartx it crashes and restarts automatically/loops with displaying the following message each time :

An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running"
Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

I was not able to debug it based on the info I found online. I am stuck.

Actually this is a bug in OS X Mavericks. To fix it follow this :

That article you linked to has nothing to do with the issue you are seeing.

I've only seen this when users have messed up their system (eg, [\#⁠2002](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2002)).

What is the output of 'what /usr/bin/mktemp'

I am not sure which link you opened. My issue was : "sudo id -u" gives 217 instead of 0. It is a bug that comes with OS X Mavericks and prevents using Virtual Box and XQuartz.
Anyone can encounter this bug on any other system where file permissions are messed up. The link I sent explains how to edit the root.plist on Mavericks to replace 217 with 0
which in my case resolved my Xquartz and VB issues. I do not know about others.
