Xorg-server-devel @1.7.99.2 on 10.5.8 does not allow paste when editing its programmes menu
===========================================================================================


I tried to add the complete invocations of GNU Emacsen 22.3, 23.1.50, and 23.1.90 (not yet installed) – and pasting them into the corresponding fields did not work, nothing of the previously from Terminal or Emacs.app copied text appeared. (Copies of entries in ~/.xinitrc etc.)

Right click and select 'paste'

You can right click and choose paste. I don't think I want to put a "Paste" option in the Edit menu because that confuses people... I'll have to try finding another way.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
