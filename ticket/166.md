TSM is not multithread safe, causes possible crash on startup
=============================================================


The machine is a Power PC Laptop - with a British Keyboard. I reinstalled 2.3.1 (messing with pbproxy) - and just stopped and started X11. X crashed. I restarted the machine - and Console is reporting:

Sep 23 07:05:04 Cloudy \[0x0-0x16016\].org.x.X11\[124\]: X11.app: Error detected in determining keyboard layout. If you are using an Apple-provided keyboard layout, please report this error at <http://xquartz.macosforge.org> and <http://bugreport.apple.com>

Sep 23 07:05:04 Cloudy \[0x0-0x16016\].org.x.X11\[124\]: X11.app: Debug Info: keyboard\_type=38, currentKeyLayoutRef=0x0, currentKeyLayoutDataRef=0x0, chr\_data=0x0

I enclose system.log for the time of the crash- and the crash dump of the initial crash - which seems keyboard related.

I didn't make it clear that restarting the machine doesn't result in a further crash. I just get the report about keyboard problems.

What layout do you use? Is it provided by Apple or a 3rd party?

Probably Apple US.. I tend to want to use \# more than £.. and use standard US from Apple.

Is this the right answer - this is what I set the Keyboard to in the menu object?
