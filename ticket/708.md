XQuartz cannot start in i18n locale
===================================


Hello,

I have Mac OS X 10.8.2 and I have downloaded X server in order to run Unix applications in internationalised environment. I need to run applications in UTF-8 environment so that multibyte characters can correctly be displayed in Unix applications. Apart from other locales, my MAC supports en\_GB.UTF-8 locale:

$ locale -a | grep en\_GB.UTF-8
en\_GB.UTF-8

Therefore, I edited /etc/launchd.conf to include the following:
setenv LANG en\_GB.UTF-8

When I reboot the Mac and run Terminal, the command line states the expected output:
$ locale
LANG="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_COLLATE="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_CTYPE="UTF-8"
LC\_MESSAGES="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_MONETARY="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_NUMERIC="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_TIME="en\_GB.UTF-8"
LC\_ALL=

Now, I want to run xterm as an example of Unix application - XQuartz starts as a result and the following warning message is produced:
$ xterm
Warning: locale not supported by Xlib, locale set to C

This actually prevents me from running Unix applications in multibyte locale. I do not understand why XQuartz does not detect (support) en\_GB.UTF-8 locale despite the fact that the locale is installed on my Mac.

Thank you for providing any feedback

Sorry for the formatting issues. Hope this is more readable :)

xterm trying to display multibyte characters

I have found out that the warning message no longer pops up as long as both LANG and LC\_ALL variables are set to correct locale in /etc/launchd.conf, e.g. en\_GB.UTF-8. However, this has not solved my problem, as multibyte characters are not displayed correctly despite XQuartz running in UTF-8 locale. See the screenshot provided from xterm while trying to display names containing multibyte characters.

As you already noticed, you set LC\_CTYPE incorrectly, closing.

You may have not noticed my last comment, because multibyte characters are still not displayed correctly in xterm, although ALL locale variables are set to some UTF-8 locale (in my case en\_GB.UTF-8).

No, the problem is your configuration.

You have:

    LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"

That is not valid.
