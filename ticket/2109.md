cant open XQuartz
=================


Hi I am not a very computer savvy person but am trying to download and open XQuartz as required to run another file. After downloading it several times I continue to get this message when I try to run in it says the disk images cannot be opened

You seem to have interrupted the download. Download the file again and wait for it to finish downloading.
