2.3.1 fails to start
====================


I have 10.5.5 and just downloaded and installed the 2.3.1 package. Now X11 fails to start. If I launch it from Finder, it eventually sits in the Dock with a "Not Responding" status. If I launch with startx, I get the following:

    font_cache: Scanning user font directories to generate X11 font caches
    font_cache: Updating FC cache
    xauth:  creating new authority file /Users/jmitchell/.serverauth.53302

    Xquartz: X11.app = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
    Xquartz: Starting X server: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 --listenonly
    X11.app: main(): argc=2
        argv[0] = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
        argv[1] = --listenonly
    Waiting for startup parameters via Mach IPC.
    X11.app: do_start_x11_server(): argc=6
        argv[0] = /usr/X11/bin/X
        argv[1] = :0
        argv[2] = -nolisten
        argv[3] = tcp
        argv[4] = -auth
        argv[5] = /Users/jmitchell/.serverauth.53302
    Xquartz starting:
    X.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple17
    Build Date: 20080905
    No matching visual for __GLcontextMode with visual class = 3 (32772), nplanes = 24
    (EE) XKB: Couldn't open rules file /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/rules/base
    font_cache: Done

    waiting for X server to begin accepting connections .

...and it just sits there. Nothing can connect to it.

Thanks in advance.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Priority** changed from *major* to *critical*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.2*

Do you have a custom ~/.xinitrc file?

Can you please 'trace' the X11.app process?

This might be the same deadlock that I've seen on startup, but I need a trace of the process to see...

This may be fixed in git if it's the deadlock that I just fixed... won't know without a trace...
