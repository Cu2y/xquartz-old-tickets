Cannot install Xquartz
======================


I have recently started using Playonmac and it requires xquartz in order to install windows base games. I Have downloaded and tried to install any version of xquartz and every time I have the installation process stops at the destination selection screen. It asks," How do you want to install the software?", but it does not allow me to choose anything. The only thing on the screen is a picture of my mac mini and the words,"Install for all users of this computer". Yet when I try to click on it nothing happens and the continue button does not light up for me to choose it. I have a Mac Mini running OS10.8.5 and 8gb Ram with 150gb of free space. Please help, it should not be this hard to install, should it?

Thanks
