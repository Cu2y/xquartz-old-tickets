When using X11, all opened windows remain blank
===============================================


Hi, I upgraded from Tiger to Leopard using the standard upgrade mechanism (not archive & install). When I tried to open X11 like I used to on Tiger, I got the bug with two open X11-Apps at the same time, that I've read about since then. Because even after I downloaded the newest version of XQuartz, I could not connect to remote computers and transfer X Sessions to my computer (the windows open, but they are completely blank), I followed the instructions to remove X11 from <http://forums.macosxhints.com/showthread.php?t=80171&page=3> (very bottom of the page). Then I used my Leopard DVD to reinstall, and then installed the XQuartz update again. But still, whenever I connect to a remote site and try to forward X Sessions, I get only white windows.

I get the following messages inside Console:

    2/28/08 10:04:23 PM org.x.X11[263] xauth:  creating new authority file /Users/username/.serverauth.263

What could I do about that?

You probably have $DISPLAY set in your environment somewhere. Please read the FAQ to get instructions to sanitize your environment.

I had read <http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ#sshXforwardingdebugging> before, and I get the following:

$ echo $DISPLAY
/tmp/launch-jfO2mr/:0

Also, every other step in the FAQ returns what it's supposed to return. Steps 2 and 3 return nothing, step 4 gives the harmless warning, step 5 gives localhost:10.0 (on the remote site) and step 6 gives /etc/ssh/sshd\_config:X11Forwarding yes
/etc/ssh/sshd\_config:X11DisplayOffset 10 (also remote).

Can I provide any more detailed information?

The two X11.apps correspond to two instances of Xquartz running. This is not a bug in Xquartz itself. Please come talk on x11-users mailing list if you need help. Here are a few pointers to help you triage the situation:

Open Terminal.app. Run 'xterm'. What happens?
Replace /A/U/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 with <http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/X11.bz2> (after decompressing of course). That will probably reveal your error in your logs (Console.app)
