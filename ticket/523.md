Fast User Switching broken in 2.7.0
===================================


If I start XQuartz (by clicking on the app) then "fast user switch" to another user and try to start XQuartz there, the second one repeatedly crashes. The message is in the bug report is:

Server is already active for display 0

> If this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock
> and start again.

The display and "-nolisten tcp" are missing from the xinit line.

If I remove the &lt;string&gt;/opt/X11/bin/Xquartz&lt;/string&gt; from /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist and reboot, both users can start XQuartz.

I'll let it sit for a while before releasing a new xinit to pull in.
