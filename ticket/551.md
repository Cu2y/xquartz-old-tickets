xterm exits silently under Lion, if LANG is en\_US
==================================================


email thread starts here: <http://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2012/Feb/msg00032.html>

This isn't exactly a crash, but after upgrading to Lion, Xquartz would not start an xterm any more. Actually, the xterm would start, and then immediately exit (exit code 0, no messages to logfiles, pretty silent!) This occurred with both 2.7.0 and 2.7.1
Other apps (xlogo, xclock, xfontsel, emacs) seem to run fine.

"xterm -hold" would stop with the window still displayed, showing an error: "Couldn't copy terminal settings."

gdb said:

    Breakpoint 1, 0x00007fff96a535c4 in _exit ()
    (gdb) bt
    #⁠0  0x00007fff96a535c4 in _exit ()
    #⁠1  0x000000010001d87f in Exit ()
    #⁠2  0x000000010000bc4f in VTparse ()
    #⁠3  0x000000010000b4f8 in VTRun ()
    #⁠4  0x000000010001b94e in main ()
    (gdb)

It turned out that a virgin shell (running in Terminal.app) COULD successfully start an xterm, and this was tracked down to the environment variable LANG.
If LANG=en\_US, the xterm exits as described. The default value was LANG=en\_US.UTF-8, and if that's set, xterms start fine.

    BillW-MacOSX-2:~ billw$ echo $LANG
    en_US.UTF-8
    BillW-MacOSX-2:~ billw$ xterm &
    [1] 1119                                      (running successfully!)
    BillW-MacOSX-2:~ billw$ export LANG=en_US
    BillW-MacOSX-2:~ billw$ xterm &
    [2] 1121
    BillW-MacOSX-2:~ billw$ 
    [2]+  Done                    xterm           (exits early !)

When you break on \_exit, you will see that xterm opened successfully and its buffer contains the string "Couldn't copy terminal settings"

That's from luit:

        rc = copyTermios(0, pty);
        if (rc < 0)
            FatalError("Couldn't copy terminal settings\n");

copyTermios just does (with error checking):

    tcgetattr(sfd, &tio);
    tcsetattr(dfd, TCSAFLUSH, &tio);

So I don't think this is an xterm or luit bug. Please open a radar at <http://bugreport.apple.com>
