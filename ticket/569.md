Some old X11 applications don't display properly with Xquartz 2.7.x
===================================================================


Where I work we have a number of applications that run on Sparc Solaris10 with the X11 display routed to Macs running 10.6.8 and XQuartz 2.6.3. These displays work just fine.

However, when I started testing out these displays with 2.7.2\_beta4, one of the applications doesn't display back to the Mac properly (still occurs with 2.7.2\_beta5).
What I see is the window comes up all white, then when the buffer gets displayed, it shows as grey. It appears as though the application really is drawing to the buffer as it consumes the correct amount of time, I can see the network usage being about the right amount, etc. It is just that the actual contents of the buffer appear to never actually get displayed. I see this with 2.7.2\_beta3, 4, 5 and 2.7.1 (I wasn't able to try 2.7.0).

Under 2.6.3, the window comes up as grey, then when the buffer gets displayed the graphic shows as expected (which has a black background).

This application was written back in about 1994/95 timeframe on VMS I believe using the Motif library. It was later ported to Solaris and has been kept up-to-date as the compilers changed, but otherwise has only seen rather minor code changes.

I have not yet had a chance to set down with our software developers yet to see the details of the calls this application is doing.

This application is triggering something that causes an incorrect display in 2.7.x while 2.6.3 doesn't trip it up. Is there anything in particular that you can think of that would be useful to help localize where the issue might be (either in XQuartz, our application or both)?

I've attached a couple of small ~600K quicktime screen captures that shows what I'm seeing (the capture was with 2.7.2\_beta3, but it still occurs with beta4 and beta5).

Thanks,

Merle

Can you try turning off xrender to see if that helps?

defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable\_render\_extension -bool no

Please try that with beta5. 2.7.1 does not support the option.

I shut down Xquartz (running 2.7.2 beta5), put in the defaults you included above, restarted Xquartz by running xclock. Then went over to Solaris to run the problem application and no change. The 'non-display' of the graphics still occurs.

Anything else you can think of I should try to help localize where the problem might be?

Thanks,
Merle

Yeah, I don't know where to start, so anything you can provide to reduce this to an easier case would be appreciated.

Over the next couple of weeks, I'll work with some of our software developers here to see if we can put together a set of motif calls that the application uses that reproduces the problem. This might help shed some light on whether it a coding problem in our application, an issue in Xquartz 2.7.x or a combination of both.

I'm having a problem with Jetbrains PhpStorm running on an Ubuntu 12.04 box not displaying properly on XQuartz 2.7.2 (xorg-server 1.12.2). The window isn't entirely grey, but the content is squished into the upper left and partially excluded when the main IDE window opens. Large blank grey bars are left on the right and bottom.

I ran the above command and reconnected. Now the window starts at about 100px x 20px, but when I maximize it I can see all the content.

Happy to attach logs if you tell me where to find them.

I'm going to need to try reproducing this myself. What version of PhpStorm do you have? Is it the latest from <http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/index.html> (4.0.2) ? Do you experience the issue immediately upon launching the application, or do you need to interact with it first?

It was 4.0.2 (they just released 4.0.3 recently, I haven't tried that), evaluation version, running on Ubuntu 12.04 x86\_64 with the oracle-java7-installer package installed. I was connecting from a Macbook running Snow Leopard.

After the splash box, the window would open up but the content would only be in a smaller portion on the top left, the bottom and right sides of the window would be solid grey, and it was impossible to resize the content into the grey portion.

After turning off xrender, the main app window spawns at a very small size but works properly once maximized.

I'm back from vacation and have been playing with this a bit. Curiously, I'm NOT seeing the issue with 2.7.3 or 2.7.4\_rc1 running on Lion or Mountain Lion. I've only seen the issue running on Snow Leopard.

Unfortunately, our software developers have been busy, so we haven't really made any headway on getting you something to try and reproduce the problem.

Let me know if there are specific tests you'd like me to run. I have a Macbook that can't be upgraded beyond Snow Leopard and access to a variety of remote Linux boxes.

If this really is specific to Snow Leopard, I'm curious what would be causing that. Please confirm that this is really OS-specific.

A little bit of information on the original problem.

Our developers have determined that changing the ordering of some of their X11 calls results in the problem I was seeing with nothing showing in the window going away. If I've understood them correctly (I'm not X11 programming savy), here is what the code was doing and what they changed it to.

With the problem, the ordering was

-   create the window
-   create the buffer for the draws
-   perform all the draws (in this case it is very large number of draws)
-   display the contents of the buffer in the window

With the changed ordering (and no displaying problem)

-   create the buffer for the draws
-   perform all the draws
-   create the window
-   display the contents of the buffer in the window

Their theory is that due to the very large number of draws that some sort of race condition occurred somewhere that is avoided by creating the display window later in the flow (the faster the Solaris box that the program is running on, the more likely we were to run into the display issue).

Unfortunately, our developers are not interested in spending time to try and create a standalone version of the binary that recreates the problem that you could use to trouble-shoot with.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *insufficient information*

Ok, well this sounds like something that is likely an xorg-server issue and not specifically an XQuartz issue. If you can provide a reduced test case, I can verify that and pass it along upstream, but short of that, I'll need to just close this as insufficient information.

Thanks.
