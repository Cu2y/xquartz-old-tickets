X11 windows appearing off screen
================================


Similar to ticket 796 (<https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/796>), I'm having problems with my X11 windows appearing off screen with multiple monitors.

I'm using ruby 2.0.0p481 with the gtk2 gem \[2.2.5\], running on OSX 10.10.3 with XQuartz 2.7.7.

My displays are arranged: M1-M2-L1, where M1 and M2 are monitors and L1 is my macbook pro.

The option "Displays have separate Spaces" is checked.

Using this script creates a window that is offscreen: <http://pastebin.com/Pf2F3m29>. I have attached it as well, in case pastebin hiccups.

If I uncheck "Displays have separate Spaces", the issue does not occur.
If I rearrange the displays so that the primary L1 screen is on the far left, the issue does not occur.

Note that the window is created at \[0, 0\], but creating it at any place within the screen space (Gdk.screen\_width/Gdk.screen\_height) yields the same result. The window will appear in Mission Control, but is completely resistant to being made visible.

After a little more investigation, it appears that the call to move is the culprit. If I move the 'window.show\_all' call so that it happens after the 'window.move' call, then the window is visible. \[on the far-left monitor, but that's ok\]. If I call 'window.move' after the 'window.show\_all', then the window is not visible.

In both cases, the window's position is reported as \[0, 0\].

I am experiencing a similar issue with XQuartz 2.7.7 and OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite with 3 displays.

I have a remote X application that I am attempting to launch, and it is not behaving well in regards to the multiple displays. Today, the login display is appearing between two (vertical) monitors, and the top-half of the window is missing due to the 'monitors have different spaces' mode, which is otherwise very useful. More importantly, I have no means of moving this dialog such that I can actually see the input forms and login. The other day, this same dialog did appear properly centered on the screen, however the subsequent windows for the main application launched in such a way that the top AND bottom of the windows were off the screen. That means I could neither resize nor move said Windows.

As the original submitter of this ticket noted, this is very similar to several existing (but closed) tickets. This is a very annoying issue, for which the only semi-acceptable workaround I've found so far is to use my Linux desktop on my 4th display. At a minimum, XQuartz needs an option to resize and center all Windows to correct for such scenarios (even a traditional 'tile windows' option would be helpful) for cases where these issues can't be otherwise corrected in the short-term.
