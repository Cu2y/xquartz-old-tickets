XQuartz programs get wrong screen resolution (MacBook 13")
==========================================================


Every program running with wine thinks that my Desktop resolution is 1280x778.

However, the real resolution is 1280x800. Consequently, some programs refuse to run in 1280x800 mode.

When I run xdpyinfo | grep dimensions, I get 1280x778 instead of 1280x800

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

The resolution of the X screen is without your menu bar. You have a RandR mode for 1280x778 (which is rootless), and you have a RandR mode for 1280x800 (which is fullscreen). Running 'xrandr' will tell you all the resolutions you are advertising to wine for its usage. Note that the "1.0" and "2.0" resolutions are special as the "traditional" rootless and fullscreen modes and not the game modes that wine expects.

Are you building wine without RandR support?

Also, please join the x11-users mailing list to reach a wider audience. There are plenty of people on that list who are using wine with XQuartz who can help.
