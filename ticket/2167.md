Paste only works after opening preferences window
=================================================


On Yosemite 10.10.4, xquartz 2.7.7 (new macbook pro, mid 2014 ed)

To paste from a native osx app into an X11 window I must first go to X11 -&gt; preferences, then paste always works ( It seems the settings are only read when the preferences window is opened ). What is even more strange, is that I must click on the X11 menu items and not use the keyboard shortcut (command + ,). The pasteboard occasionally will get the correct value after a few minutes, but this clearly is no way to work. This is a huge productivity hit since cut from a native app into X11 should not require two additional clicks.

No variation in X11 -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Pasteboard settings seem to affect this, nor does my input device (option+click in touchpad or 3rd button in mouse). I currently have "Enable synching", "Update Pasteboard when clipboard changes", "update clipboard when pasteboard changes", "update primary (middle-click) when pasteboard changes", and "update pasteboard immediately when new text is selected". Again, I've found no variation in these matter.

thanks much for the help

Going to preferences shouldn't be needed. This is the first anyone has ever said of that, and the code hasn't been worked on in about 5 years.

Paste works for me right away. I launched xterm and middle clicked. The contents of the OS X pasteboard (which were set before launching XQaurtz) were pasted.

This does work when the pasteboard has the contents before xquartz is started. If you extend your test case to a series of cut/paste actions you'll see that the following paste action returns the original buffer contents, not the new.

It works for me when the pasteboard contents are selected before pasting.
