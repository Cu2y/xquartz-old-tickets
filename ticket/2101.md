XQuartz 2.7.7 broken after Java update
======================================


After a java update this morning (to Java 8 - I think svn 37) XQuartz is broken with the following maeesage being returned: <span class="underline">glXExtensionInit: AddExtensions failed. Reinstalled XQuartz and rebooted, just to be sure, but error repeated. Help! I need to invoice clients and can't launch gnucash at present.
</span>

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

If an extension isn't supported, java should deal with that. Sorry.
