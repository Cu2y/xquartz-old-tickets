X11 generates wrong input events for command-click
==================================================


As of 2.3.0, command-clicking is no longer usable, because X11 generates input events that make it look like the mouse button has been released instantly. So whatever menu you hoped to call up doesn't stay there long enough to be selected from.

Experimentation with xev shows that it's not the application's fault.
I see this sent on command key down:

KeyPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269108072, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x0, keycode 63 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta\_L), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XFilterEvent returns: False

... which looks OK, but \*all\* of these are sent on mouse button down:

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269110401, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x10, keycode 63 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta\_L), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XFilterEvent returns: False

ButtonPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269110401, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x0, button 3, same\_screen YES

ButtonRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269110401, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x400, button 3, same\_screen YES

KeyPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269110401, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x0, keycode 63 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta\_L), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XFilterEvent returns: False

\*Nothing\* is sent on mouse release

Sent on command key up:

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0x1600001,

> root 0x45, subw 0x0, time 1269131129, (102,85), root:(678,168),
> state 0x10, keycode 63 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta\_L), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XFilterEvent returns: False

(If it matters, this is an early-2008 Macbook Pro with the new improved trackpad.)

Another user points out that the X11 input preference "Emulate three button mouse" must be on to make this happen.

Can you please try the attached file? Download it, then replace /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 with it (you should install the 2.3.1\_beta1 package first). I believe this should solve your button emulation problem.

The 2.3.1 beta is here:

I didn't try that file, but I did download 2.3.1\_beta2, and I confirm this problem appears fixed. Thanks!
