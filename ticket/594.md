HiDPI (Retina display) support
==============================


Since switching to HiDPI with my 30" display, I noticed that applications running in X11 (2.7.2) are displayed enlarged without using the full, high resolution.

I wonder if they could be made aware of the HiDPI display.

Yeah, there's not much we can really do here. It may be possible to make the frames better, but there's not much we can do about the contents ... maybe some filtering, but... yeah, not really much to do with the current architecture.
