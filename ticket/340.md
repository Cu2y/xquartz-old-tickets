AIGLX: glXChooseVisual gives a GL\_STEREO visual when none is supported
=======================================================================


Hello, I have traced a bug in VMD from <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/> to what we believe is a bug in X11. I am using XQuartz 2.4.0 (xorg-server 1.5.3-apple14). In the code below, glXChooseVisual() returns a valid visual, but the card I'm using is a not a stereo card. It's a GeForce 7300 GT. glxinfo does not report GLX\_STEREO extension. Can you comment on what is going on? Is this an XQuartz bug?

> int conf\[\] = {GLX\_DOUBLEBUFFER, GLX\_RGBA, GLX\_DEPTH\_SIZE, 16, GLX\_STEREO,
>
> > GLX\_STENCIL\_SIZE, 1,
> > GLX\_RED\_SIZE, 8, GLX\_GREEN\_SIZE, 8, GLX\_BLUE\_SIZE, 8, None};
>
> vi = glXChooseVisual(glxsrv-&gt;dpy, glxsrv-&gt;dpyScreen, conf);

I think that card is capable of stereo (even if you don't have the extra hardware for it).

I'll look into this when my queue shrinks a tad.

Thanks for checking. I made an error. This does not occur on my desktop, it only occurs on certain other macs. Perhaps as you point out my card actually is stereo enabled. Here is what the vendor told me, John Stone from VMD about the behavior on the affected machines:

"What is going on here is that one of the calls to glXChooseVisual() that
requests a stereoscopic window (the GLX\_STEREO parameter), is succeeding
in getting a stereoscopic window even though it apparently should not.
So far as I know, no Macs with ATI Radeon 9600 graphics chipsets are able
to do stereo, so this combined with the observed behavior your users are
getting is why I believe it to be an error in their (XOrg) GLX implementation."

Here is the code where GLX gives a bad visual:

> int conf\[\] = {GLX\_DOUBLEBUFFER, GLX\_RGBA, GLX\_DEPTH\_SIZE, dsize,
>
> > GLX\_STEREO,
> > GLX\_STENCIL\_SIZE, 1,
> > GLX\_RED\_SIZE, 8, GLX\_GREEN\_SIZE, 8, GLX\_BLUE\_SIZE, 8, None};
>
> vi = glXChooseVisual(glxsrv-&gt;dpy, glxsrv-&gt;dpyScreen, conf);

Herre is the glxinfo and xdpyinfo and uname from a machine where the problem recurs. Tunneling through ssh is enabled here, but disabling it has no effect on the problem.

Dang sorry about the poor formatting. Stupid line endings. If you need it to be cleaned up I can, but I think you can get the gist of it.

-   **Component** changed from *xserver* to *GLX*

I just noticed your mention of ssh here... You're using AIGLX? I assumed this was locally. Does this work locally with 2.5.1\_beta1?

-   **Milestone** changed from *later* to *OSX*

So the only way to really deal with this would be to provide a toggle to disable stereo visuals even though OpenGL.framework tells us that they are available. I don't want to do that given that it's easier (and more correct) do do this as a setting in the client.

Please test if this is still an issue with Lion, and if it is, open a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> ... then report the number of the ticket here, so I can followup with the OpenGL.framework or ATI guys as to why they're returning stereo capability when there is none.

-   **Status** changed from *reopened* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *wontfix*

Is this still a problem with Lion? Closing as WONTFIX since this isn't an issue that can be correctly addressed in XQuartz.
