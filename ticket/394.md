XGetSubImage fails with 2.5.0 release
=====================================


Screen captures via tvrd() in IDL are scrambled by both Leopard and Snow Leopard builds of 2.5.0.

The following appears once for each row of the captured window:

> % X windows protocol error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes).

Was this working in an older release?

Yes, it was working.

I can confirm that I have also been having this problem... Rolling back to 2.4.0 solved the issue (I am running 10.5.8)

Are either of you able to use SnowLeopard?

If not, can you please install 2.5.0 on Leopard and then install this server update:
<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11.bin-1.5.3-apple18.bz2>

if that works, try this one:
<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11.bin-1.6.5-apple2.bz2>

See <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases#xorg-server> for information on how to test these versions.

I'm afraid I don't have access to Snow Leopard license for this machine (yet), but I will install 2.5.0 and then the server updates as indicated and keep you informed. Thanks!

I can test on Snow Leopard.
What do you need?

On SL, does 2.3.5 (the X11.app one) work?

Please install 2.5.1\_beta3, then try out these server builds (note that they go inside XQuartz.app and not X11.app as the above instructions state):

Please try this one:
<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/X11.bin-1.5.3-apple21.bz2>

then try this one if the above works:
<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/X11.bin-1.6.5-apple5.bz2>

Hi Jeremy.

(On Leopard 10.5.8)

I installed X11.app version 2.5.0, and then the X11.bin-1.5.3-apple18 server update as specified.

Using IDL, the X display now does not open: X11 initializes, and the X11 icon appears on the dock, but the window never appears for IDL. Thus it is not currently possible to test whether IDL's TVRD() function would work.

One thing I noticed: in the Activity monitor this new xorg-server-updated X11.app is now described as Intel(64bit), whereas every other routine running is just Intel... Is there a Leopard/SL mixup somewhere?

I haven't tried the 1.6.5 update yet, is it worth doing that or will it have the same problem?

You can try running the 32bit versio by running (from terminal):

    arch -i386 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

The 64bit version should work in Leopard... /shrug

On SL:
2.3.5 (1.4.2-apple53) works.
2.5.1b3 (1.3.5-apple21) works.
2.5.1b3 (1.6.5-apple5) works.
After exiting 2.5.1b3, a reboot is needed before restarting any of the X11s, or
IDL will not succeed at opening an X11 window.

After updating the X11.bin, you did restart XQuartz,app, right?

You don't need to reboot for IDL to work. Just start IDL from an xterm started from XQuartz.app if X11.app is your default.

*rowe@…* commented *[on May 2, 2010](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/394#comment:15 "May 2, 2010 at 4:25 PM PDT")*

Using 2.5.0 with the xorg server update 1.5.3-apple18 on Leopard, I found that first starting X11 using

arch -i386 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

...worked well, i.e. IDL \*did\* correctly open up an X11 Window, and the plots read in to image arrays using TVRD() looked fine. So it was just the (defaultly called) 64bit version that was failing before. Also tried the update 1.6.5-apple2, exactly the same behaviour: doesn't work unless you previously open the arch -i386 X11.bin

Also noticed that both the 64bit X11.bin (1.5.3 and 1.6.5) refuse to quit: they disappear from the dock momentarily, then reopen seconds after.

You're right. The "need" to reboot was being caused by "export DISPLAY=:0" in my .bashrc.

Did you verify the version number in X11-&gt;About X11 when reporting the working / broken versions?

For the working versions, yes. Don't remember if I checked for the broken case.

Ok, well can you then also test various 1.7.x servers to see what the minimum version is that introduces this bug:

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
