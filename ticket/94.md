Openoffice and X11 2.2.0.1 on OSX Leopart
=========================================


I recently upgrade the X11 on my PPC iMac running Leopard (10.5.2) to fix a problem with Ardour not starting.

This worked OK but has broken OpenOffice. I was running version 2.0 so upgraded to the latest 2.4 but OpenOffice just hangs having started the X11 process in a terminal window.

Can I either fix this or downgrade to an earlier version of X11?

This is a bug in the OO.o launcher. Bug them, not us. They set DISPLAY which is bad. You can bypass the launcher by just running /Applications/Open\\ Office\*/Contents/MacOS/soffice
