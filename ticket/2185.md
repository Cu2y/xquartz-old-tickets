how do I disable XQuartz in El Capitan
======================================


I've seen some references to disabling, but none mention El Capitan and I'm not comfortable using unix commands.

Can you please confirm/explain in SIMPLE TERMS how to either disable or remove XQuartz from my Mac Powerbook Pro (El Capitan 10.11). Ever since I installed it my internet hangs after a few minutes online.

Thanks!

XQuartz being installed has nothing to do with your internet problems.
