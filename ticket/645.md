"X11 cannot be found"!
======================


Hello - I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.1... I installed an application that required the latest X11... I was referred to your site - downloaded and install 2.7.3 and now when I attempt to run the application I get a dialog box stating "X11 cannot be found"!

Attached is the dialog box of the error message.

Help please!

This application worked fine before installing XQuartz 2.7.3

It looks like this XQuartz changed the DISPLAY variable, without "notifying" the other application that depend on X11 --

please fix!!

You already filed this as [\#⁠644](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/644). I already responded in that ticket.

XQuartz "notifies" the other applications that depend on X11 \*by setting\* the $DISPLAY environment variable. This is why you are notified to logout and back in after installing the first time (so your $DISPLAY environment variable will be set for them).

This is not an OS X nor an XQuartz bug. It looks like some 3rd party software has been broken for the past 5 years, and we're just finding out now. Please answer my question in ticket [\#⁠644](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/644) if you want help diagnosing your issue and reporting it to the proper developer.
