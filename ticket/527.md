Gnome panel beside dock
=======================


Hi, I have a VM on my mac running linux
I open XQuartz and run the application "ssh -Y user@10.211.55.3 gnome-session &"
(i've configured some gconf settings to disable desktop painting, etc)

In V2.6.3 i used to be able to have my gnome-panel down the bottom next to the dock but in V2.7.0 i can no longer get this to work.

I've attached pictures of the behaviour

Hmm... are you using quartz-wm still as your WM, or are you using metacity?

I believe its quartz-wm.
ps on the linux VM shows NO metacity processes running
ps on OSX host shows /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm running

Can you please try the quartz-wm from 2.6.3 while on 2.7.0? You can do the following:

    sudo cp /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm-2.6.3
    # install 2.7.0
    sudo mv /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm-2.7.0
    sudo ln -s quartz-wm-2.6.3 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm

No response, so pushing back.

quartz-wm sources have been released OSS. Please try to bisect the issue to figure out where the issue was introduced.

I've tried the below steps and the gnome menu bar is now allowed to be beside the dock (the expected behavior)

Ok, so then it's definitely a change in quartz-wm between XQuartz-2.6.3 and XQuartz-2.7.0

Can you please try bisecting quartz-wm to find the exact commit that caused the problem. There were only around 20 changes between the releases, so it shouldn't be too difficult to bisect.
