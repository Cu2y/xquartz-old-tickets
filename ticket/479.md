Under XQuartz 2.6.2, new nedit main windows do not get focus when created
=========================================================================


Using Nedit built via fink (note, fink links against libs in /usr/X11/lib) and having the preference set to give new windows focus, a new nedit window does not get focus, though it is created on top and Xquartz is brought forward as the foreground app.

I did not see this with XQuartz 2.6.1. Also, I do not see this with other non-nedit applications. Also, within nedit, help windows, pop-ups, etc do get focus as expected, but not new main windows (eg, 'File -&gt; New Window').

I don't see this with 2.7.0\_rc1. Please reopen if you still have issues.

I just got a chance to try this out in 2.7.0\_rc1

Nedit built against openmotif still shows the problem. However, Nedit built against lesstif does not show the problem. My workaround is to use Nedit with lesstif which is acceptable to me.
