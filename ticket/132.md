xquartz starts using 100% cpu
=============================


With the following recipe:

Focus the x11 window, then (quickly) focus another window and re-focus the x11 window

Xquartz starts using 100% cpu and the only way to "fix" it is to focus another window.
I can reproduce it almost always on 10.5.3 powerpc.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.0*

What does "X11-&gt;About X11" reveal for version information?
Please provide a sample of the hanging process for me by using /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app
What applications do you see this with? Can you reproduce the problem just using xterm?
What is the other window that you click on to "fix" the issue. Another X11 window? A non-X11 window?
Does clicking the desktop "fix" the problem?

Xquartz 2.2.3 - (xorg-server 1.3.0-apple21)

Not sure how can I get a sample of the xquartz process while it is using 100% cpu, since focusing another window makes the problem disappear.
Yes I can reproduce it just using an xterm.
for "focus other window" I mean focus (command-tab) a non-x11 window.
Actually just moving the mouse seems to fix it too.

To take a sample, open up Activity Monitor.app, double click the process you want to sample, then click the 'sample' button.

you can start the sample, switch to X11, trigger the issue, then just wait for the sampling to finish.

As soon as you move the mouse, it stops consuming 100% cpu?

Ok, i'll try to provide a sample soon.
I just noticed that it stops whenever there is any input event, key press, mouse move/button press.

Does the sample provide any useful info?

The sample just looks like it's doing normal activity... nothing out of the ordinary. Can you reproduce this in 2.3.0-rc7?

I cannot reproduce it with 2.3.0.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/132#comment:8):
I'm getting this exact behavior on 10.5.6 on an intel core duo laptop using xquartz 2.3.2. Repeatable every time. Can this be re-opened?
