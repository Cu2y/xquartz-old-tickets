X11 extracting update hanging problem
=====================================


Hi,

I know there's a known issue with this hanging, and that I should install manually. Can you tell me how to install manually? Couldn't find anything online.

Thanks.

-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

I have no idea what you mean here. This is a bug tracker. Ask for help on the mailing list. However, to install manually, goto <http://xquartz.macosforge.org> and download the installer.
