It works fine for me and everyone else.

As indicated by the syslog in the sysdiagnose, please delete your ~/.xinitrc file

that cant be the case when there are several other people with the same issue.
your reply is not helpful
you are supposed to help here

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Sep 8, 2015](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2164#comment:5 "September 8, 2015 at 2:50 PM PDT")*

This is not a support forum. Please join the x11-users mailing list using the link to the top left.

The .xinitrc file is something that you created.

You can delete it like you would any other file (eg: by running 'rm ~/.xinitrc')

i didn't create this file i merely downloaded x11 which has not been updated for years and appears incompatible with Yosemite 10.10.5

Apples-MBP-2:~ apple$ rm~/.xinitrc
-bash: rm~/.xinitrc: No such file or directory

is the outcome of your advice

any further suggestions?

now we get the same problem and the above error

X11 DOES NOT WORK ON YOSEMITE

Replying to [neilsrini@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2164#comment:6):

> i didn't create this file

The evidence is to the contrary.

> i merely downloaded x11 which has not been updated for years

2.7.8\_rc1 was released a few months ago.

> and appears incompatible with Yosemite 10.10.5

It's not. There are certainly bugs because there are no active maintainers, but it is OSS, so if you want to contribute fixes, by all means, please do so.

> Apples-MBP-2:~ apple$ rm~/.xinitrc
> -bash: rm~/.xinitrc: No such file or directory

> is the outcome of your advice

You forgot the space.

> any further suggestions?

If you are unable to solve the problem based on my reply above, join the mailing list for support. As I already mentioned, this is not a support forum. I will not reply here further but will help you on the mailing list if you require further assistance.

i have no idea what that file is i did not creat it it must be a flaw in the app that is not YOSEMITE compatible

2.7.8\_rc1 -- is a beta that doesn't work

X11 fails to work on mac

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Sep 9, 2015](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2164#comment:13 "September 9, 2015 at 11:38 AM PDT")*

Ok, one last time. I absolutely will stop responding to you here.

2.7.8\_rc1 is a release candidate that is release-worthy. I just haven't had time to reversion it as a release version.

It is Yosemite compatible.

This is user error. You have a ~/.xinitrc file which is causing this problem. The app does not create it.

If you create a new user account on your system and login as the new user, you will be able to use XQuartz just fine (because the new user will not have the ~/.xinitrc file).
