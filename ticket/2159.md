xquartz download fails
======================


Trying to download xquartz either by curl from <https://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg> (as part of a Homebrew install request) or via my browser directly from your landing page fails.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Seems to work fine here.
