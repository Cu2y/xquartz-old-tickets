startx/xinit behaviour is confusing
===================================


startx/xinit is still useful if you want to call launch the xserver, start your choice of window manager and generally initialise the x environment without launching a program.

However, currently, startx/xinit starts Xquartz with a standard 'exec' icon on the Dock, and a menu bar entitled 'X' (as opposed to 'X11'). It would be better if this kind of startup gave you the normal icon, X11 menubar and preferences.

startx is pretty much "the way" to start the server now. launchd uses it, and server\_main() in X11.app uses it when launchd support is disabled. booyah
