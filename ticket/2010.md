XQuartz hangs until Force Quit
==============================


XQuartz gets to a state where it no longer responds to keypresses, window moves, mouse clicks, or new events. It basically hangs, although the rest of the system is working just fine. I'm able to reproduce this when I run ssh -Y to another host. Note that that other host is on the same network and isn't experiencing any downtime, and the xterm I ran that from also is not responding. I also run virt-manager on that host for example. But I'm able to consistently get stalls (or they could be called crashes) of this type where the only option I have is to Force Quit XQuartz.

Please attach a sysdiagnose taken when you see the hank.
