Wine window color keying is very slow under XQuartz and causes flicker
======================================================================


See <http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31978> for the details.

According to the Wine developers, it works fine under Linux and hence is probably an XQuartz issue. The wine commit that introduced the issue is <http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/commitdiff/edea44f0ff995aadaaadb866a022832c16301e4a>

If you have any ideas about where to look for the cause, I can check it out.

Yeah, they've implemented it using XSHAPE. XSHAPE is a rather old server extension which nobody really ever used in practice, so I'm surprised that wine is using it now. I highly suspect that the XSHAPE extension in XQuartz is under-optimized, but it doesn't look like that would be the cause of your issue.

Try taking a spindump while it's doing this to determine where we're spending a lot of time.

In case you still have 10.6 system with Shark 4.7.3 (Xcode 3.2.5) or compatible available, I've attached a full system trace (I never quite got the hang of Instruments). I've also performed (separate) sampling traces of wine and XQuartz. Both show a lot of time spent in the kernel.

Looking at the system trace, there's quite a bit of pingpong going on between wine and X11.bin via wine calls to XPutImage that in turn calls PutSubImage (a lot, or PutSubImage performs a lot of individual write operations). Every PutSubImage operation results in a write by wine to the xserver socket, which seems to be quite high overhead (writing data by client, select wake-up of server, starting a timer on the server side, select-sleep on client side waiting for server getting ready to receive more data, reading the data on the server side, stopping the timer on the server side). Such a single sequence seems to take about 150 microseconds, but there are a \*lot\* of them.

Maybe it doesn't cause problems on Linux because they presumably use DRI rather than socket communication between libX11 and the xserver for every PutSubImage operation. Also, is XQuartz' XSHAPE extension possibly responsible for trying to group multiple of these PutSubImage operations into single operations beforehand?

Sorry, that probably doesn't make sense since XQuartz also uses DRI...

No, DRI is not used for XPutImage (even on Linux)

XQuartz "DRI" is much different that Linux DRI.

I've looked a bit at what's happening using gdb and an unoptimized libX11, and wine is sending a continuous stream of 478x98x32bpp bitmaps via XPutImage (= 187376 bytes per transfer). These individual bitmaps fit in a single buffer and are transmitted via the following (pretty much optimal, as far as I can tell) path:

    #⁠0  0x905b352a in writev$UNIX2003 ()
    #⁠1  0x40bc214d in _xcb_conn_wait ()

Maybe on Linux the XShape result does not always encompass the entire progress bar drawing area and hence sends far less data? (the progress bar does change only slightly every iteration) Can I look somewhere at the XQuartz-specific bits of XShape?

In the wine call to to XShapeCombineRectangles:

    XShapeCombineRectangles( gdi_display, surface->window, ShapeBounding, 0, 0,
                             (XRectangle *)data->Buffer, data->rdh.nCount, ShapeSet, YXBanded );

the number of rectangles is always 6 and they look like this (absolute addresses used because gdb was confused by the optimizer):

    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+0)
    $92 = {
      x = 5, 
      y = 0, 
      width = 468, 
      height = 1
    }
    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+1)
    $93 = {
      x = 3, 
      y = 1, 
      width = 472, 
      height = 1
    }
    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+2)
    $94 = {
      x = 2, 
      y = 2, 
      width = 474, 
      height = 1
    }
    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+3)
    $95 = {
      x = 1, 
      y = 3, 
      width = 476, 
      height = 2
    }
    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+4)
    $96 = {
      x = 0, 
      y = 5, 
      width = 478, 
      height = 92
    }
    (gdb) p *(((XRectangle *)0x17ab50)+5)
    $97 = {
      x = 1, 
      y = 97, 
      width = 476, 
      height = 1
    }

The bounding rectangle for that is 478x98 pixels if I'm not mistaken, which matches the size of what XPutImage draws later on. I haven't debugged yet what the server does as a the result of that call though.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
