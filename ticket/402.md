Wine doesn't play ball continued?
=================================


I try to run an opengl application in wine (1.1.44) on mac os x snow leopard using xquartz on a mac mini server.

It's a coin standard application (www.coin3d.org) which runs under wine in linux but not on the mac. Starting the application (the app is coin-based, coin 3.1.0 or later, SoWin 1.3 or later) leads to the following message box:

Coin warning in SoWinGLWidgetP::wglMakeCurrent(): The rendering context &lt;000001F8, 0012F030&gt;, could not be made current, as wglMakeCurrent() failed with error message: Success.

After that other message boxes appear, the last is:

Could not find any supported OpenGL mode on your system. Application will exit.

After that the application terminates.

To test it yourself, I can send you the application. Also I can send the source codes and the project files if it helps. Please let me know how I can help solving this issue ...
