GPU MUX does switch back to integrated GPU after IGLX context is destroyed
==========================================================================


Running VirtualBox on a FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE amd64 machine via ssh X11 forwarding back to a Retina Macbook Pro running 10.9.1 with XQuartz 2.7.5 turns on the discrete GPU. After you quit VirtualBox the discrete GPU remains active with X11.app as a dependency.

Results:
Once you quit VirtualBox the discrete GPU remains active as reported by gfxCardStatus (and System Information.app)
X11.app is a dependency reported by gfxCardStatus

Expected:
Once you quit VirtualBox the integrated GPU is turned on

Reproduce:
0) With XQuartz already running and "Automatic graphics switching" turned on (Energy Saver.prefPane)
1) ssh -X host VirtualBox
2) wait for VirtualBox to load
3) quit VirtualBox

This likely won't get fixed without someone contributing a patch...

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
