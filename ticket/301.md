xfig crashes 2.4.0 on second call to export menu
================================================


Everything goes swimmingly using xfig to edit and draw a figure, and the first time the export function (to save as a pdf, jpg, whatever) is called it works as expected. But the second time export is selected from the xfig file menu, the whole lot dies, xfig and X11. xfig and associated dependencies have been installed via fink.
My hunch is that it is something to do with the transient window it is trying to open, because I have experienced a few other oddities with window management with this release (none of them reproducible yet), such as confusion over which window is above another. The transient window (containing the export options) never appears the second time.

This code has changed a bit betweek 2.4.0 and 2.5.0. Does this still happen with 2.5.0? Is it reproducible? Can you tell me how to reproduce it (how did you get / build / use xfig)?

I have exactly the same problem. Happens also with the "open" dialog as well as the "export".

I am using MacPorts, OSX 10.6.3. I am using the port version "xfig @3.2.5\_8".

Also, yes, this is reproducible. And by "reproducible", I mean "happens every time without fail."

And as long as I'm spamming this board apparently, I'll tell you that upgrading to 2.5.0 fixes the problem.
