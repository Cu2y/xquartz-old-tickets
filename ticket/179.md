OS windows hiding functionality does not work well with XQuartz
===============================================================


The window hiding functionality in Mac OS X 10.5.5 does not seem to work well in conjunction with XQuartz 2.3.1 (also tested with 2.1.5).

I tested only with the Dutch (nl\_NL) version of Mac OS X 10.5.5.

Below are various individual test descriptions.

-   - - -

1.  Steps to reproduce:

A1. Start X11
A2. Go to the X11 menu

1.  Expected results:

-   see the menu option "Verberg andere" (hide others) with the key combo Alt-Cmd-H, just like it shows in other applications.

1.  Actual results:

-   see the menu option "Verberg andere" (hide others), but without the key combo Alt-Cmd-H (unexpected)

<!-- -->

-   - - -

1.  Steps to reproduce:

B1. Start X11
B2. Press Alt-Cmd-H to hide other windows

1.  Expected results:

-   windows of other applications become invisible

1.  Actual results:

-   nothing happens (unexpected)

<!-- -->

-   - - -

1.  Steps to reproduce:

C1. Start X11 (an xterm automatically shows)
C2. Switch to Finder
C3. Press Alt-Cmd-H to hide other windows

1.  Expected results:

-   other windows are hidden, including any open X11 windows

1.  Actual results:

-   on 2.1.5: other windows are hidden except all open X11 windows (unexpected)
-   on 2.3.1: other windows are hidden, including all open X11 windows (correct and expected).

I added the key-equiv in git.

I retested with X11 2.3.2.1 just today, on Mac OS X 10.5.6 Dutch (nl\_NL). The problem remains. The option to hide other windows ("Verberg andere") does not have a keyboard shortcut.

Please reopen this ticket.

works for me. enable key equivalents in X11 preferences or ask on x11-users for help.

I have enabled key equivalents. I will post one or more screenshots showing the issue. Perhaps it is related to the localization of the OS?

I've attached some screenshots.

Note that I have this issue on 2 different machines:

1.  The Mac Mini on which I made the screenshots.
2.  A MacBook Pro (Oct 2006) with Mac OS X 10.5.6.

Yes, it should only work for English. If you want to submit an updated locale for your region, I'll gladly include it as well.

Jermey, I'd like to look into that. Can you provide a hint as to where I start looking regarding modification of localizations? Is there a guide of some sorts? I googled, but could not find any pointers.

Herewith I confirm this is indeed fixed in XQuartz 2.3.3.2 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple42).

Thanks. btw, I assume you are using the localization update as well. Please let me know if anything in them seems incorrect and I'll forward it to the right people.
