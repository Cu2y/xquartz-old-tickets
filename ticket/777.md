XQuartz
=======


Xquartz is slowing down Inkscape like crazy. Any action like zoom etc is taking AGES.....

What makes you think this is XQuartz's fault? Please attach any metrics or evidence to support your claim. I highly doubt the performance issue is from XQuartz.

I downloaded XQuartz again for Mountain Lion. The copy i got b4 was 2.6.4? For Panther. This one is 2.7 something. It solved the problem. I had Firefox going at the time. I tried everything b4 i realized i maybe had the wrong edition.
Sorry to have bothered you.
I have dumped Photoshop and Illustrator for the time being instead using InkScape and The Gimp. New learning curves. See how they go.

Hello
Thank you for the reply regarding the "slow" performance of Inkscape maybe because of XQuartz
