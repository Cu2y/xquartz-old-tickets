Crash in glViewport after xp\_attach\_gl\_context call
======================================================


Hi,

please tell me if I'm reporting this in the wrong place, but I believe the bug is in xplugin, which belongs to XQuartz.

A game I'm playing in wine has started crashing consistently. It did have the same crash in SL as well, but only occasionally. It's a crash in glViewport with this backtrace:

    #⁠0  0x441a08dd in glViewport ()
    #⁠1  0x4418f8be in surface_make_current ()
    #⁠2  0x4418df73 in apple_glx_make_current_context ()
    #⁠3  0x4419649e in applegl_bind_context ()
    #⁠4  0x441935fb in MakeContextCurrent ()
    #⁠5  0x4419372a in glXMakeCurrent ()
    #⁠6  0x43e17a9e in X11DRV_wglMakeCurrent (dev=0x6405cc0, hglrc=0x6629200) at opengl.c:1933

disassembling glViewport shows it's accessing a global variable pointer which is NULL. I assume that's supposed to be the current surface.

surface\_make\_current can be seen here: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/glx/apple/apple_glx_surface.c> .
It makes the call
`error = xp_attach_gl_context(ac->context_obj, s->surface_id);`
right before it calls glViewport. I assume that call is supposed to set the current surface, or return an error. The problem is that the surface becomes NULL, but an error is not reported.

Perhaps there is a timing issue involved?

LIBGL\_DIAGNOSTICS=1 prints:

    DIAG: apple_glx_create_context: ac 0x49b68b90 ac->context_obj 0x40cb5c00
    DIAG: apple_glx_destroy_context: ac 0x49b68b90 ac->context_obj 0x40cb5c00
    DIAG: apple_glx_create_context: ac 0x49b68b90 ac->context_obj 0x40cb5c00
    DIAG: surface_make_current: ac->context_obj 0x40cb5c00 s->surface_id 21

The last line is right before the crash.

There are however similar calls earlier that do not crash:

    DIAG: apple_glx_create_context: ac 0x402a2c30 ac->context_obj 0x40a01a00
    DIAG: apple_glx_destroy_context: ac 0x402a2c30 ac->context_obj 0x40a01a00
    DIAG: apple_glx_create_context: ac 0x402a2c30 ac->context_obj 0x40a01a00
    DIAG: surface_make_current: ac->context_obj 0x40a01a00 s->surface_id 21
    DIAG: surface_make_current: drawable 0x1600011
    DIAG: applegl_bind_context: error NO

Since the above is perhaps a bit little to go on, I also did a stepping through xp\_attach\_gl\_context. It calls in turn xp\_synchronize, pthread\_mutex\_lock, \_xp\_hash\_table\_lookup, CGLSetSurface, pthread\_mutex\_unlock, \_xp\_gl\_error. CGLSetSurface and \_xp\_gl\_error both return 0. \_xp\_hash\_table\_lookup returns a pointer which points to the number 21 in the first 32 bits (same as surface\_id above).

    xp_attach_gl_context(ac->context_obj, s->surface_id)

That attaches the given CGLContext to the surface given. It does not change any surfaces. What do you mean by "The problem is that the surface becomes NULL" ... what surface becomes NULL? That function can not change s as it has no access to it.

This does sound eerily familiar and sounds like an issue I fixed a couple weeks ago. What is the version of your X11 server? Does it have these changes (they are in 1.10.4):

Hi,

I won't claim that I know this code very well, I might very well be confused about it. Nor have I used OpenGL myself in a long time so can't remember much about how it works. I was running trunk from your repo from a week or so ago, updated it now, bug still happens. It has those commits in the log.

Perhaps what I meant with surface is actually context. I don't have these terms straight. :)

The crash is that glViewpoint tries to access a NULL pointer, I believe it's supposed to be a struct with function pointers. I assumed the xp\_attach\_gl\_context was what was supposed to put something else there instead of the NULL, but perhaps that was a too quick assumption.

Just to be clear, the crash is in the client program, not in the server.

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Expected*
-   **Component** changed from *Xplugin* to *GLX*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.0*

What version of the server are you running? As I mentioned above, I just pushed a fix for a very similar issue, so this may already be fixed and you just have an old server. The fix is not in 2.7.0\_beta1 but will be in the next beta.

I'm running trunk (master I guess in git language) from your repo as of yesterday. But I can wait and test in beta2. libGL is from macports however, and it's linked to /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib (lion 10.7.1). Should I relink it to /opt/X11/lib/ ?

It doesn't matter which libXplugin you are using since they're both pretty much the same right now.

Does the problem go away if you use mesa 7.10.x instead of 7.11 (use XQuartz 2.7.0\_beta1 if you don't want to build mesa yourself)?

Do you have a way for me to easily reproduce the issue?

I recompiled wine linking to libs in/opt/X11 (both libGL and libXplugin) instead of /opt/local, which is what I assume you meant. /opt/X11 is from 2.7beta1. This crash no longer happens (there's another one every 10 games or so, but it's unrelated).

Thanks for the help. I don't know of any other way to reproduce it than to run the Magic the Gathering - Duels of the planeswalker 2012 Demo in wine (it's available on Steam). At the end of a match, on the loading screen going out from it, it was crashing every time.

I figured I might as well try to write up instructions to reproduce, even though they're kinda long. But weirdly, I can't reproduce it with wine built by macports, even though it uses the same libraries that were crashing for me earlier. Not sure what's going on, perhaps it was some weird one-off thing? Tried both stock 2.7beta1 server and the one I compiled myself.

Anyway might as well include the instructions I wrote up:

    sudo port install wine-devel winetricks
      (this will take a long time)
    export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine.dotpcrash
    ftp http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi
    wine msiexec /i SteamInstall.msi
      Click through the installer, you'll have to login/register with Steam
    winetricks xact_jun2010
    wine start steam://install/49480
    Click through the options, start the game when installed.
    Exit game.
    Edit $HOME/.wine.dotpcrash/drive_c/Program/Steam/steamapps/common/magic\ the\ gathering\ dotp\ 2012/config.cfg and change fullscreen from 1 to 0
    Start the game again.
    Go to campaign. I'm not sure now if you have to play through a whole match or if it's enough to press escape and concede after it's started.

For some reason I also couldn't unset fullscreen inside the game now. That was possible back when I first installed it in June. But I'm unsure if that's a wine bug or an X one (didn't research it).

sigh, wiki screwed that up majorly. Perhaps it doesn't matter.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*

Do you have an update on this? 2.7.0\_beta2 and 2.7.0\_beta3 pull in mesa 7.11 (beta1 had 7.10), so I expect that you should be having problems with current XQuartz if you were having problems with mesa 7.11 before.

The fact that some of the problems just disappeared (2 comments up) leads me to pause.

The crash point in glViewport makes me think that it wasn't finding the glapi dispatch table. This is consistent with the backtrace:

    #⁠0  0x441a08dd in glViewport ()
    #⁠1  0x4418f8be in surface_make_current ()
    #⁠2  0x4418df73 in apple_glx_make_current_context ()
    #⁠3  0x4419649e in applegl_bind_context ()
    #⁠4  0x441935fb in MakeContextCurrent ()
    #⁠5  0x4419372a in glXMakeCurrent ()

which is supposed to \*set\* the dispatch table.

I'll do an audit of that codepath soon, but I'm curious what the status of things are on your end with XQuartz 2.7.0\_beta3

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

I believe this is fixed with:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?h=7.11&id=bf7b347c1041edc77472c117e0ffcfbb71d5c13b>

which will be in beta4. Please either test a build of libGL from current mesa or wait for the next beta.
