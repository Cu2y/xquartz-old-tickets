XQuartz cannot be installed on 10.8 DP3 because developer is unidentified
=========================================================================


When you try to run the pkg from 2.6.1 you get this error on 10.8 DP3. This is not an working, but a fatal error that blocks installation.

“XQuartz.pkg” comes from an unidentified developer.

Your security preferences are set to block installation of applications from unidentified developers.

“XQuartz.pkg” is on the disk image “XQuartz-2.7.1.dmg”. Safari downloaded this disk image today at 02:29.

You mean 2.7.1, not 2.6.1.

And yes, 2.7.1 isn't signed. 2.7.2\_beta5 is though.
