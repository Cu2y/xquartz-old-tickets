x11 2.1.4 hangs during install
==============================


Hi,

I recently tried to install xquartz version 2.1.4 on a Leopard (10.5.2) x86 macbook, and it hangs during the "Installing x11" portion of the installer. The bar stays at ~1% for hours with no apparent progress and no substantial cpu usage.

Any help on this would be apprecated. Thanks!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.2.0*

Can you please trace the process? Open up

/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app

Then double click on the installer application and click the 'sample' button

I'm experiencing the same. It's stuck on Configuring Installation step forever. Unfortunately I can't sample yet due to sampler error:

sample cannot examine process 374 for unknown reasons, even though it appears to exist.

I found where is the problem because i have the same problem with the version 2.2.0.1 . The problem happend only if you stop the download of the package and continue the package download from the download safari window clicking on continue the download. If you start a new download the problem don't happen.

You just need restart the download and don't stop it anytime if you do it, you may restart the download again.

Don't ask me why.
