xinit: unable to connect to X server: Operation timed out
=========================================================


I just installed XQuartz-2.7.7 on a Mac Mini running OS X 10.9.4 and X isn't working properly. While it does start and I see a X client window appear, the xquartz-wm doesn't appear to be running so there is no way for me to move or resize the window. I noticed this also happened when I installed XQuartz-2.7.6. XQuartz-2.7.5 does work normally so something broke between those versions. Here is what I see on the console log:

I've updated my Mini to OS X 10.10.2 and installed XQuartz-2.7.7 and I'm now seeing the same problem. Can someone tell me how to fix this?

Likely a local configuration error. Try with a fresh user account and work back from there.

I created a new user account without modifying its environment and I still see the same problem when I launch an X client like xterm. The xterm window is displayed but quartz-wm is not starting so there is no way to manipulate the window. Also note that I can manually start quartz-wm and then X works as I expect. Can you recommend a better way of diagnosing this issue?

I noticed that nolisten\_tcp was set to 0 in org.macosforge.xquartz.X11. When I set it to 1, X11/quartz-wm started working normally.

Sounds like you're trying to use TCP to connect rather than using the socket.

I had no idea what method was being used to connect to the X server. What I do know is that I am using ssh to connect from OS X to a virtualbox Solaris guest session with ForwardX11 and ForwardX11Trusted set to yes so I can run X clients within the Solaris vbox guest and have the window displayed via XQuartz on my Mac. It would have been nice if the X server would have logged something about refusing the connection because of the current settings so I could have figured this out sooner.

As the X11 server itself isn't even listening on the port, it has no idea that someone is trying to connect to it and thus doesn't get a connection that it can refuse and log about. It's the lack of \*anything\* listening on that port that results in the connection failure.

It also sounds like from above that you've messed with /tmp, so the unix socket isn't working.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2032#comment:8):

> It also sounds like from above that you've messed with /tmp, so the unix socket isn't working.

No I have not messed with /tmp. On my Mac Mini I see:
$ ls -ld /tmp
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root wheel 11 Feb 2 15:29 /tmp@ -&gt; private/tmp
$ ls -Lld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt@ 18 root wheel 612 Feb 20 12:46 /tmp/

which is normal. BTW, if the unix socket isn't working then why does X work normally now with nolisten\_tcp set to 1? AFAICT, in X prefs this means that "Allow connections from network clients" is off/unchecked which I assume means that X isn't listening for TCP connections.

Oh, I misread (double negative, sigh). In any event, it looks like a local configuration issue, so not a bug. Thanks.
