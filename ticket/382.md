R function 'x11()' hangs under version 2.5.0 for Snow Leopard
=============================================================


When running R.app (<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>) from command-line, default plot window 'x11()' now hangs during any plot statement. So in R I now need to physically invoke 'quartz()' before any plot statement.

I am building it now on MacPorts., but I don't use R.

Can you please give me the steps to take to trigger the issue?

Does R hang, or does X11 hang?

Can you please attach a sample of the hanging process?

It worked for me. I just built the latest version from Mac Ports and ran it like this:

    ~/src/macports-trunk/dports $ R
