X11/Fast User Switching causes white rectangles to appear
=========================================================


Steps to reproduce:

User A launches X11 (which spawns an xterm)

User A minimizes the spawned xterm to the Dock

User A switches to User B

User B switches to User A

Result: A white rectangle exists where the xterm would have been (had it not been minimized)
If the xterm is un-minimized, the white rectangle disappears.

I believe this problem may be related to ticket [\#⁠18](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/18). I did not notice this behavior in the original
10.5 implementation of X11.

Machine: Intel Macbook (C2D/GMA950)
OS: 10.5.1
X11: 2.1.0.1
