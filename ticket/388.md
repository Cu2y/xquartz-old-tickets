Root window becomes visible after screen saver activation
=========================================================


If I run X11 in rootless mode, then wait for the screen saver to activate, the desktop will be completely covered by a strange black window when I dismiss the screen saver. Running xwininfo on the window produces:

    xwininfo: Window id: 0x381 (the root window) (has no name)

      Absolute upper-left X:  0
      Absolute upper-left Y:  0
      Relative upper-left X:  0
      Relative upper-left Y:  0
      Width: 1920
      Height: 1178
      Depth: 24
      Visual: 0x22
      Visual Class: TrueColor
      Border width: 0
      Class: InputOutput
      Colormap: 0x21 (installed)
      Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
      Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
      Backing Store State: NotUseful
      Save Under State: no
      Map State: IsViewable
      Override Redirect State: no
      Corners:  +0+0  -0+0  -0-0  +0-0
      -geometry 1920x1178+0+0

Once the window is visible, the only way to dismiss it is to close the X server.

xdpyinfo shows that the server supports the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension, so that might have something to do with it.

-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*

Are you talking about an X11 screensaver or the OSX screensaver?

When did this first start happening?

The OS X screensaver.

First, I thought it happened when the computer went to sleep. But I put the computer to sleep several times and couldn't reproduce it.

It usually happens when I leave the computer unattended for awhile. That's why I think it has to do with the OS X screensaver. (I don't have XScreensaver installed anyway, so how could it be that?) I could be wrong though (as I often have been).

> When did this first start happening?

Actually, this has been a problem since the 2.5.0 betas. Yes, I know, I should have reported this earlier.

You mentioned the X11 screensaver extension which is why I thought you might be talking about that.

I am always in rootless mode (I hardly ever use fullscreen mode) and have never seen this.

So 2.3.5 (X11.app on 10.6.3) works fine for you?

Hmm... I just tried 2.5.1 beta3 and I don't see the problem anymore.

Although cdavis recently re-confirmed that the bug is gone for him, it's not gone for me. My machine is an "early 2009" Mac mini wth NVidia 9400, running Mac OSX 10.5.8 (with all security updates as of May 2011) and XQuartz 2.6.1.

> First, I thought it happened when the computer went to sleep.

My observation is that it *only* happens when the machine puts itself to sleep (after due idle time), not when I select "suspend" from the menus.

> Please run 'xlsclients' ... also use 'xwininfo -all' and click on the window.

xlsclients -al shows nothing: no single client is running.
Wine is the only client that I use and it's what caused X11.app to start initially. Wine has exited long before the machine was put to sleep.
xwininfo is attached.

I'm using rootless mode too. I have no notes about when I initially encountered this bug; it was long ago - possibly even XQuartz 2.3.3?

xwininfo -all (of root window)
