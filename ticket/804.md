Download of X11 for latest Mac OS changes Ruby behavior
=======================================================


A Ruby program that I use as a benchmark no longer runs since I downloaded X11 this morning (2013-10-28). I tracked down the bug. Ruby used to allow block variables to be used outside of a block if a local variable of the same name existed going into the block. This no longer appears to be the case. I gather that the X11 download included a Ruby update as well. Is that true?

I'll check the Ruby site next to see if my assumption about the Ruby change is, in fact, correct.

Thanks,
Jim Shapiro

XQuartz has nothing to do with ruby.
