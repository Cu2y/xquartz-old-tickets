French translation for X11
==========================


I've compiled this French translation for X11. Just replace the French.lproj folder in /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/Resources/ with the one in the zip file.

Sorry, I ended up not using your translation because I was able to update ALL the translations by releasing our internal versions.

Would you be so kind as to review the new french translation in 2.3.3 and let me know if there are any problems or concerns that you have with it?

Thanks so much for your help in this.
