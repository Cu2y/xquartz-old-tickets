XQuartz steals and/or loses keyboard focus
==========================================


With XQuartz running I use Fast User Switching to go to the login window. I then leave the computer for some time. XQuartz will steal the focus, meaning there is no way with the keyboard to reassign focus to the username/password text entry fields, including with Command-Tab.

Equally, often while working in an xterm window in XQuartz, the window will lose the focus completely. In this case I can use Command-Tab to reselect the window. It's pretty annoying though.

The loosing focus issue is a longstanding bug in OS X that can't easily be worked around in XQuartz. It would require an almost complete rewrite.

The stealing focus from the login window is something I've never heard before. It should not even be possible.

What version of OS X are you running? What makes you think that XQuartz is stealing focus (ie: what evidence do you have)?

Can you upload images or logs?
