cmd-tab doesn't bring active X11 window forward
===============================================


To reproduce:

Open an xterm.
Switch to a non-X11 application with a big full-screen window.
Switch back to X11 using cmd-tab. The xterm doesn't come forward.
Switch back to the non-X11 app.
Switch back to X11 by clicking on its Dock icon. The xterm comes forward as expected.

Expected:
cmd-tab should bring forward the xterm, just as clicking the Dock icon does.
