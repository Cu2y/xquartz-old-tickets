Incorrect window selection/focus in Exposé
==========================================


When using Exposé to bring a background window to the foreground (i.e. to have focus), X will bring that window to the front but will not set it to be the active window (the original window stays in focus). As a consequence, when you try to click on the window you just brought forward, it will pop back behind the old window to its original location in the "window stack". In effect, Exposé does not function other than to show all active windows, because you have no ability to select any of them using Exposé.

I tested this with GIMP for Mac OS X version 2.4.3 and Xquartz 2.1.2
