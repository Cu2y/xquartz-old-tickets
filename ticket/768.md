Graphics rendering with Cairo incomplete when using XQuartz but works with old X11
==================================================================================


I am a developer of GrADS, a visualization tool for meteorological data. GrADS uses an X window for its interactive display window, but it also has a batch mode, so you can create graphics output without the use of X. We have developed a new interface for the Cairo library to do the rendering. The problem I am having is with the X rendering when using XQuartz. Everything looks right when I use the old (deprecated) X11 application on my Mac, but if I use XQuartz, I get an incomplete rendering. The batch-mode renderings by Cairo are correct, and the non-Cairo version of GrADS does not exhibit the problem with the X window display, so I am pretty sure that Cairo and XQuartz are not playing well together.

I have written a short C program (given below) to demonstrate the problem -- it mimics the GrADS interface with X and Cairo, but draws only some very basic graphical elements: a string of text and a set of 24 concentric circles made up of many small line segments. With XQuartz, only the text appears and the circles are not drawn. A screen shot of what the output should look like is at <http://iges.org/jma/x11.png>.

I am running Mac OS X 10.7.5. When running the old X11 application, the version information in the "About X11" window says: XQuartz 2.6.5 (xorg-server 1.10.6). When running XQuartz, the version numbers are more recent: XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0).

I have posted this question to the Cairo community and got no helpful response, but I don't think that the Cairo code is to blame in this situation. My xdemo.c program is given below.

/\*

-   xdemo.c
-   -   This is a demo C program to illustrate a problem with rendering graphics to an X11 window
-   using the Cairo library. It opens a 500x500 X window, writes the word 'Hello!', draws 24
-   concentric circles made up of tiny line segments in varying shades of gray, then waits for
-   the user to type 'q' to close the window and exit the program.
-   -   The program was compiled on a Mac running OSX 10.7.5:
-   gcc xdemo.c -o xdemo -I/opt/local/include/cairo -L/opt/local/lib -lcairo -lX11
-   and on a linux server (CentOS 5.9):
-   gcc xdemo.c -o xdemo -I/usr/include/cairo -L/usr/lib64 -lcairo -lX11
-   -   Both the local (OSX) and remote (CentOS) versions exhibit the same problematic behavior:
-   -   The rendering is fine with XQuartz 2.6.5 (xorg-server 1.10.6) -- see <http://iges.org/jma/x11.png>
-   The rendering is incomplete when using XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0) -- the circles are not drawn. \*/

I have uploaded a screen shot of the partially rendered X window when using Xquartz : <http://iges.org/jma/xquartz.png>
At first, no circles were drawn, but after I moved another X window over my demo window and then moved it away, this small fraction of the full drawing appeared. Maybe this is helpful information...

In the x11-users forum, Jeremy asked me to test which XQuartz release introduced the problem.
I installed this one: XQuartz 2.7.0 (xorg-server 1.11.2) and it showed the buggy behavior.
I installed this one: XQuartz 2.6.3 (xorg-server 1.10.3) and everything works perfectly.

Could this be the same problem as [\#⁠525](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/525)?

I think this ticket has a lot in common with ticket [\#⁠525](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/525). I see that ticket was closed today -- I hope that rc4 will resolve this one as well.

The changes in 2.7.5\_rc4 have fixed this problem. Thank you!!!
