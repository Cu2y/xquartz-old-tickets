geomview running much slower
============================


Geomview is running much slower in order to load a scene, in comparison with the way it was running on X11 on Tiger.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

If that is the case, then it is an issue with geomview and not with X.
