Copy/Paste does not work in XQuartz
===================================


-   OSX 10.8.2
-   XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0)

First time use of XQuartz on this system (installed 27 September 2012).
Installed to allow use of MacPort construction of:

-   wine-crossover @11.2.2 x11/wine-crossover
-   Built with: Xcode -Version 4.5.1 (4G1004)

Using Crossover bottle with PyLotRO and LOTRO.

PyLotRO is in Python and historically used the Crossover Xinterface.
This all worked fine. It was possible to cut and paste from the PyLotRO control window into any OSX window -- typically Terminal with Emacs, but also TextEdit. Similarly to copy from OSX -- any application into the chat window of LOTRO worked. Turbine modified the client which triggered a bug in WINE, necessitating a patched version of WINE be created.

That was done in MacPorts and the PyLotRO/LOTRO combination again worked...
However, it was not possible to copy from the PyLotRO control window to Terminal and Emacs or TextEdit.

Similarly, it is no longer possible to copy from anywhere in OSX and paste it into the Chat window.

XQuartz was installed by clicking on the X11 icon in Utilities and "following the instructions."

I note that the XQuartz "Edit" menu offers ONLY a copy option (which does nothing.)

The "setup" is simple...

-   1- Launch XQuartz
-   2- Open a terminal window and launch WINE using:
-   WINEPREFIX="/Users/magill/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/LOTRO-4" wine ~/Library/Application\\ Support/CrossOver/Bottles/LOTRO-4/drive\_c/Program\\ Files/PyLotRO/pylotro.exe

PyLotRo launches accepts login information, then launches the control window, followed by the LOTRO client window.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Version** set to *2.7.4 (xserver-1.13.0)*
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Important*
-   **Component** changed from *xserver* to *pbproxy*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

The copy option in the menu proxies X11's PRIMARY buffer to NSPasteboard.

Does your application actually have something in the PRIMARY buffer?

If you want to proxy CLIPBOARD in addition to PRIMARY, look at the preferences.

If you still have trouble, please try to find a simpler example than something using wine.
