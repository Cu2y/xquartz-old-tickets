Dual screen problem
===================


When using X11 applications with an external monitor in dual-screen layout, newly opened windows (gimp dialogs, plots of gnuplot etc.) are placed out of both screens, and are completely unreachable by any means. I tried Window/Zoom, changing resolutions of both screens, changing display layouts in Settings, Apple Scripts to gather all windows, using an external software (Forget Me Not) to solve the problem, but without luck. This problem renders X11 apps completely unusable with dual-screens.
