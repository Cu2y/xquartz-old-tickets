XQuartz 2.75 and key map problems with VirtualBox
=================================================


Aftering installing XQuartz 2.72 on Mac OS 10.8.5 we have the following problems using VirtualBox on a remote host:

1.  Local machine: Mac OS 10.8.5, Terminal App, ssh -X into remote host

<!-- -->

1.  Remote Host

Ubuntu 11
VirtualBox 4.1.2
TERM=xterm-color
SHELL=/bin/bash
DISPLAY=localhost:11.0

On the remote host command line, the keys all work fine.
When I run VirtualBox and start the VM, and get the VM login prompt, the keys don't seem to be working and the VM Log shows it doesn't recognize the keymap (see attached VBox.log

We did not have this problem with 2.74, but down grading to 2.74 the problem still persists.
If we use a Windows-7 computer and X-Win32, we have no problems connecting to the host, running VirtualBox and logging into the VM.

This problem with running XQuartz on Mac OS X is reproducible on two separate Apple Mac computers (iMac and MacBook Pro).

We didn't change anything on the local machines (other than installing XQuartz 2.75) or the Host.

Does VirtualBox mess with the keymap? I don't really see how this can be a problem on our end. We allow clients to modify the keymap, and if they do bad things, well... that's unfortunate =(
