Update from X11 environment issue
=================================


I was updating X11 to ver 2.7.6. The package download finished and was waiting at Install on the download progress window, when power went off. After restarting the update app started download from beginning. Why not check if the download succeeded, and download from the last failure point if necessary.

> After restarting the update app started download from beginning

What do you mean by "the update app"? There is no update app, and it sounds like you already downloaded the installer.

The installer's progress bar is an installation progress bar, not a download progress bar. Is that what you're talking about? If so, there's no way for it to continue from where it left off because it doesn't know that state, and it is much safer to just redo the entire install.
