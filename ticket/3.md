xinitrc / client race condition
===============================


When a client opens a connection, it gets displayed before we finish executing xinitrc (and by extension parsing Xresources)

This should be \*mostly\* fixed due to a sleep we now do to allow the X server to start before we run the client. This is still not bullet-proof but works in most cases. We should change it to be interrupt based.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.1.3* to *2.3.0*

This isn't really that big of a concern anymore due to the sleep(). it still exists for applications run directly from Terminal.app to start the X server, but the issue is a much lower priority now.
