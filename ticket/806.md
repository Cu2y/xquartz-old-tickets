Xquartz windows disappear on secondary display in Mavericks
===========================================================


If the option to use a secondary display as it's own space is selected in System Preferences, Mission Control, any X11 windows you try to drag to that display will just "disappear". If you drag the window to the display & let it go, you won't be able to see it unless you invoke Mission Control. Even then, you can see it, but you can't move it back.

Actually there's more going on here than just an inability to move windows between displays/lose displays.

I got a good hint today when I, don't bother telling me I'm bad for doing this.. I know, sudo'd to run Wireshark to avoid setting up the rights for packet capture on the NICs.

This produces a warning window admonishing you for running as root etc. which you can dismiss, however, when running each display in it's own space this didn't turn up.

Opening spaces revealed the window which was placed to the left of my main Wireshark windows. When I selected it I noticed a huge rectangular blue highlight covering 2 screens worth, including the main Wireshark window.

This happened at work where I hook up to an external display and my Mac is sat on my left. I speculate that for some reason the X server believes that both screens are one large screen even when in seperate displays for spaces mode.

Strictly speaking, the change in spec to have a seperate space for each screen is treating each display as a seperate display. Surely in X terms the new functionality should be expressed by addressing each display with a space as a seperate screen rather than trying to merge them all off :0..? Now that may be confusing to some that have run X on other display systems with multiple screens but at least a) It would ensure the window landed on the right screen and b) It would be more correct in terms of the X specification.

Thoughts?
