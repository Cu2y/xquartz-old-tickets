Opening Matlab
==============


I don't know if this is an appropriate question, but I'm running out of options. I downloaded XQuartz 2.5.3 b/c Apple reformatted my Comp to Snow Leopard(I had Leopard previously) after a repair and did not provide me with the installation disk so that I could install X11.

I want to run Matlab R2008b on my machine but matlab can't seem to find the XQuartz X11. I made a directory called X11R6(apparently the directory matlab searches for) in the usr directory and made a symbolic link to the X11 directory in usr, as per the description of a fix I found while googling, but that didn't seem to work. Any advise is appreciated. I hope I provided enough info. Thanks

I believe the version here is superior to the version installed by Software Updates anyways because we're limited in what we can push through SU ... but that's still odd about your experience with the repair. If they updated you to SL, they should've charged you for the upgrade, so they should've given you disks.

As for what Matlab is doing ... I have no idea. It's possible that they have some archaic (Tiger) way of starting the X11 server rather than just connecting to $DISPLAY... so:

1) Did you logout and login again as advised by the XQuartz installer?

2) Also try creating the symlink to /usr/X11 in addition to /usr/X11R6

3) Try creating symlink for /usr/bin/quartz-wm -&gt; /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm

4) Try creating symlinks for all of /usr/lib/libXplugin.\* -&gt; /opt/X11/lib/usr/lib/libXplugin.\* if not present (these should be on your system already)

That being said, this sounds like it's not really a bug. You should ask on the x11-users mailing list if you need more help (see the mailing lists link at the top of the column to the left).
