nedit crashes on launch
=======================


Using the uninstall listed for Snow Leopard (<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ>) on a Lion install (I sure hope it didn't break anything) was the only way to get back a critical application:

Nedit.

After loading the XQuartz, logging out and back in and then starting Nedit I got a 'signal 6' from the application, when it would quit. Usually it just stopped without displaying a window on the screen. Same for the 'Xterm' from the Application menu. It was 'running' but nothing was displayed. By running I mean that it was in the list of applications if you right click on the X application in the menu bar. And you could select these applications (nedit, xterm, etc) and they would have a check mark next to them, as if they were the active application. Xeyes and Xman would display correctly.

Attempts to launch other applications got running apps with no visible windows. Path problem? I don't know, I didn't stick around to find out.

Nedit does rely on Motif, and that could have been an issue as well, I don't' know. I did recompile the application from source using the /opt/X11 path for the includes/libraries, so it wasn't that it was linked to the wrong libraries.

This here as an FYI as requested from this page:

-   **Type** changed from *usability* to *crash*
-   **Summary** changed from *Why I rolled back from 2.7.1* to *nedit crashes on launch*
-   **Priority** changed from *Nice to Have* to *Expected*
-   **Milestone** changed from *later* to *2.7.2*

Nobody reported any such issues during the couple months of testing leading up to 2.7.1, and 2.7.1 really isn't that different from 2.7.0 in any regard that would cause nedit to misbehave.

Can you please provide more information, such as the crash logs, etc.
