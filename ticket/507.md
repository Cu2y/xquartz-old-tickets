cmd-opt-a and RandR fullscreen can't restore fullscreen correctly
=================================================================


Using cmd-opt-a I'm able to escape from fullscreen successfully, but I'm not able to restore a fullscreen session. Sometimes the app is offset on the screen whereby only half of the app is visible and sometimes it is centered correctly. But every time, the mouse cursor seems to be offset so that I cannot move the cursor within the entire viewable app area.
