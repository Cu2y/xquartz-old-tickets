Stuck mightymouse button after squeezing sides to trigger expose
================================================================


Apologies for the formatting of this ticket, it seems the tool I'm typing into to submit this ticket does not respect individual carriage returns but it does so for double carriage returns!

I have a mightymouse whose side buttons are set to trigger expose when squeezed. If I invoke expose this way and select a regular Mac window and then repeat and select an X11 window then a variety of stuck mouse button situations arise e.g. you're stuck in the middle of a selection rectangle, you're stuck in the middle of a window move. In each case, the location of the mouse arrow on the screen is wildly offset from where X11 thinks the mouse location is. Additionally, just doing expose events to induce this issue, I see evidence in the X11 CAD tools I was using that a regular keyboard character depression was interpreted e.g. "i" or "z".

My debug strategy (based solely on Jeremy's advice) is as follows:

I have a ~/.xinitrc.d directory which contains two files:

99-quartz-wm.sh which contains:
export DEBUG=1
exec /usr/bin/quartz-wm &gt; /tmp/quartz-wm.log 2&gt;&1

and 50-xterm.sh which contains:
exec /opt/X11/bin/xterm

Launch X11 (which an xterm with no decoration ) and then enter:
DEBUG=1 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm &gt;& /tmp/quartz-wm.log

So to summarize, when this X11 issue comes up I:

-   run "xev" and "xinput test pointer" in separate terminal windows (although I don't know how to interpret what I see).
-   provide the tail end of /tmp/quartz-wm.log
-   "killall quartz-wm" and then try restarting with "/opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm" (I also tried "/usr/bin/quartz-wm").

I have found no reliable way to restore X11 to it's normal state. I have had the above procedure work and not work to fix the problem.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Important*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.3*

Can you try isolating when this occurred by installing older versions of XQuartz? That might help.

I have a mighty mouse somewhere, so I'll try reproducing this when I get back home next week. Since this has been in for a while, it probably won't hold up 2.6.3, but I'll do my best to get it in.

Also, can you try entering Exposé in different locations to see if that has any effect? Do each of these with X11 as the front application and with something else as the front app:

    1) With the pointer over the desktop
    2) With the pointer inside an X11 window
    3) With the pointer inside an X11 window's titlebar

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/486#comment:2):

I tried all of the above when X11 was the front application and in each case the problem was still there. I then tried again with something else as the front application and in each case X11 was unaffected and worked fine.

-   **Version** set to *2.6.0 (xserver-1.9.3)*
-   **Milestone** changed from *2.6.3* to *2.7.0*

We use keyState in <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/hw/xquartz/X11Application.m?id=bf9fd0a83eef771ee018438f05e2d9f20b43539b> to manage this for keys, but we don't do it for mouse buttons (and never have).

It looks to me like this issue has always been present. I don't see how it could be a new problem.

It's too late to do this in 2.6.3, but I'll be trying to bring it into 2.7.0 (and maybe a future 2.6.x if there are any)

I took a little look at this today and decided that using a similar approach as keyState is just a bad idea since we have 4 different pointer devices to consider. I'm asking Peter for some advise, but my initial work is on PR-486 in git.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

This isn't in 2.7.1\_rc2, but a fix should be in the next release, whether it's 2.7.1\_rc3 or 2.7.1 ...

Well today, while waiting for someone to get ready to play Aion. I ran across the ability to make modifications to the  system.cfg file by creating a system.ovr file.
I’ve been toying around with some of the settings, namely the ability to log the chat windows. It appears that the file Chat.log is written instantaneously which in turn means good things for writing a combat log parser. It seems, there is a possibility of actually doing a live one. I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up but I’ve already started working on an after the fact one that could be used once a pvp session or pve session is over.
here’s how it works:

1.  Create a system.ovr file in the top level [Aion kinah](http://www.goodsmmo.com/) install directory
2.  Within it put:

g\_chatlog = “1″
log\_IncludeTime = “1″
log\_Verbosity = “1″
log\_FileVerbosity = “1″
The only major limitations of this is, it doesn’t create new logs for each session (hello giant chat log) and it doesn’t separate combat from kinah chat bull, so I need to filter that out.
