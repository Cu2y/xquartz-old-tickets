Windows can get lost under menu bars on secondary displays
==========================================================


Launching nedit produces a window without any window-manager adornments. eyes works fine, so not sure why nedit doesn't. Nedit used to work on the previous version of Xquartz.

Gaah. Autocorrect has completely garbled that.

The application that has no window-manager adornments is 'nedit' not 'edit', and the one that works well is 'xeyes' not 'eyes'...

Please attach screenshots to show the issue you are reporting.

When did this issue start happening (what version, including release candidates and betas)?

As far as I know, I was up-to-date with xquartz. I upgraded to Mavericks and ran an X app (nedit I think) and it offered me the chance to update to 2.7.5, so I did. I've never run any release-candidates or betas to my knowledge.

On a hunch, I tried setting my spaces to not be independent-per-screen (who wanted \*that\* feature, anyway ?) and it restored my menu bars. I guess this can be laid at the feet of the new weird-as-heck display driver when spaces are set to be independent-per-screen.

Oh, that's what you're talking about...

Yeah, that's a known bug.
