3-finger and 4-finger gestures no longer work after installing XQuartz
======================================================================


Hi, I just installed XQuartz yesterday (v2.2.7) to try out Inkscape. I logged out and back in as instructed and noticed pretty soon after that I couldn't navigate between full screen apps. Both the 3/4 finger swipe left/right gesture, and the Command+arrow key shortcuts failed to work. I also noticed that the 3-finger swipe up to open mission control gesture no longer works. I double-checked my system preferences, but all gestures were enabled on their default values.

After I finished the little bit or work I needed to do in Inkscape, I tried "uninstalling" things by dragging the Inkscape and XQuartz apps to the trashcan. That didn't fix the gesture issue. Then after a bit of googling around I found the uninstall instructions in your faq and followed them, including another log out and back in, but things were \*still\* broken. As I was writing this ticket, I decided that I should probably reboot for good measure and that \*did\* resolve the issues on my system. (So there's a second issue: the uninstall instructions should specify a reboot rather than logging in and out.)

I'm on OS X Yosimite 10.10.2 if that matters.

Oh, and there was a inconsistent issue with the Command+Spacebar spotlight search - sometimes it would disappear after I typed a letter. Its also fixed now that I'm back to Apple's X11.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Uh... I think you're confused.

1.  XQuartz has nothing to do with the functionality you see broken.

1.  I'm not sure why you would see something as "fixed now that I'm back to Apple's X11" because we stopped shipping XQuartz with OS X in Mountain Lion, and you're on Yosemite, so there is no OS-provided X11.app.

1.  Are you sure? If there's no relationship at all, then that's a heck of a coincidence that it breaks when I install XQuartz and resumes working after I uninstall and reboot. I suppose it could have been Inkscape that broke it, but XQuartz seems like the more likely culprit out of the two. There were no other changes to the software on my computer in the past two days and I've never experienced these issues before.

1.  Ok, so it's not X11, it's whatever Apple does instead. Regardless of what ships with OS X now, I downloaded XQuartz and things broke, then I uninstalled it and rebooted and things worked again. The point was that logging out and back in wasn't enough to fully uninstall things the way the FAQ suggests; it took a reboot as well.

I filed this because your FAQ specifically says "*Please file a bug report to let us know why you reverted to the system X11.app, so we can address the problem in a future release.*" (<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ#UninstallSnowLeopardorLater>) - If you're just going to tell me I'm wrong and close the ticket, then you should probably remove that line from the FAQ as well.
