X 2.3.1 not supporting multiple language input
==============================================


Hello

I installed today XQuartz 2.3.1 and, when using Inkscape (and other tools), if I change the input map from Leopard from English to Portuguese, Inkscape continues writing with the English map.

This was not hapening before (unfortunately I do not now what was my previous version).

Also, I found an option in X preferences that seemed to solve this problem (given its description), but I didn't notice any change.

Let me know how I can help debugging this problem.
