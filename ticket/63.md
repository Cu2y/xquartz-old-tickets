Focus Follows Mouse broken with 2.1.4
=====================================


The value wm\_ffm in org.x.X11.plist used to cause focus to follow mouse when set to 1. it no longer does this.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.2.0*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

Try setting it to true instead of 1 maybe...

defaults write org.x.X11 wm\_ffm -bool true
