launchd claims dubious permissions
==================================


Hello,
I saw a interesting line at system.log and I thought I better share:
27.02.2008 16:22:25 com.apple.launchctl.System\[2\] Notice launchctl: Dubious permissions on file (skipping): /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.x.font\_cache.plist

I have taken these steps to keep my X11 updated:
1) Installed X11 with 10.5 upgrade installation
2) Kept up to date with snapshots from this site
3) Installed 10.5.2
4) Kept up to date with snapshots from this site

This is a Quad G5 running ordinary HFS+ Journaling.

I thought repairpermissions (diskutil) may help but it didn't.

(In addition)

ls -l /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.x.font\_cache.plist
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root wheel 516 14 Şub 09:07 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.x.font\_cache.plist

I have also checked my x11 (2.1.4) package via Pacifist.app , it says no permissions have changed at all.

update: when I make the file "read only", launchd no more complains and it actually launches the .sh script as you can see::
27.02.2008 16:59:57 org.x.font\_cache\[14\] Notice font\_cache.sh: Done

So the permissions should be 444 instead of 644?

-   **Milestone** set to *2.2.0*

No, it should be 644 (it's complaining about the group write bit)

This is fixed in git for 2.2
