Fullscreen/Rootless and resolution switching
============================================


I'm not an X expert, so not sure how to go about asking this, or if it already been asked or worked on.

I use Xquartz a lot to run Wine programs, and overall it runs good...
a major feature it needs to be able to do (which Xfree86 for OSX builds seem to be able to do already) is have the running application be able to not only change between rootless and fullscreen mode, but when in fullscreen mode to be able to change the actual resolution the screen is running... without any Xserver restarts. I'd try to do a patch myself, but its way over my head...
Xfree86 has major other issues, but it already does this in my testing, going years back, and the build Codeweavers uses in Crossover Mac does this very nicely for Wine... I'm just wondering why this is something XQuartz doesn't do... and if it can be added.
