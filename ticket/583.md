Mouse/Tablet Input Broken in 2.7.2 (using Gimp 2.8)
===================================================


Setup: Mac OSX 10.7.3 (Lion). Intuos4 Tablet + Standard Microsoft 3-Button Mouse. Topic is XOrg Tablet/Mouse Input using Gimp.

When running Gimp 2.6.X (latest release until a week ago) and the latest XQuartz at the time (no later than 2.7.1), I used to find that when selecting the Brush tool and trying to draw on an image, nothing would happen if I did this using the mouse, but if I instead drew using the tablet, it worked fine. (both should work). With the mouse, the cursor is moved around but nothing happens when you left-click to actually draw.

When Gimp 2.8 came out a week ago, this issue was fixed, finally. Good stuff. However, I just upgrade to the latest XQuartz - 2.7.2, and the exact same input issue occurs again. Downgrading to 2.7.1 resolves the issue, so something's definitely changed that's not playing nicely with Gimp 2.8. Thus I'm reluctantly going to stay with 2.7.1 for now.

Clearly without more info it's probably very hard to pinpoint who is to blame here - Gimp or XOrg (XQuartz) but thought I'd mention the problem in case you are interested from the XQuartz pov.

NB Unable to choose 2.7.2 as the version in your Version field for this bug (only goes up to 2.7.1). Also unsure whether correct Component field chosen.

There was quite a bit of change in xinput in this version, but people have been using it fine during the rc cycle. It sounds like maybe you have a misconfigured gimp. Please bring this up on the x11-users mailing list. I'll try setting up gimp here for testing, but the tablet seems to be working right from 'xinput --test-xi2'

gimp-2.6 built from MacPorts works fine. I can use my Logitech 3-button mouse, and the pen/eraser work perfectly.

Make sure you open gimp's preferences and goto 'Input Devices' then click 'Configure Extended Input Devices' ... toggle 'pen' and 'eraser' from Disabled to 'Screen' (or window if that's what you prefer). The valuator order should match gimp's defaults (x, y, p, tx, ty)

gimp-2.8 is not yet updated on MacPorts, but since everything is working in gimp-2.6, I don't see how this would be an XQuartz issue.

And Gimp-2.8.0p1 from <http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html> works for me as well.
