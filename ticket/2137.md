Impossibility of correctly registering a problem
================================================


Sorry guys - I couldn't work out how to report my problem, so it's gone in here. It might be good to have some sort of feedback link for support or complaints that don't seem to be bug related. So that's bug A. Although this is altogether a blocker for me, so maybe it's a real bug!

Bug B is a question of ambiguity. Your wiki page says:
OS X Software/Security Updates and XQuartz (Leopard Only)

OS X Software Updates have included some of the work done by this project, but for various reasons, Apple cannot ship the latest and greatest version offered by this site. Since our package clobbers Apple's X11.app, their SU will clobber ours. Because of this, you may experience conflicts after doing a Software Update from Apple. It is suggested that you install the latest XQuartz release after installing an update to OS X Leopard.

and at the end of the page it certainly says "Last modified 2 months ago" but there is no indication of what was modified - probably "Latest Releases", but who knows?

What I want to know is "Does your comment on incompatibility with Leopard really apply to Leopard only?" If so, it would be good to have a statement at the end of the paragraph warning about Leopard to the effect that Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite are not affected by this problem. My worry is that someone updated "Latest Releases" and modified the date without considering that the "Leopard Only" comment may not have been overtaken by the release of later versions. I can't install on Yosemite until I know the answer.

We have a link to the mailing lists on the very top of the navigation bar on the left.

Yes, that is true for Leopard. Snow Leopard and later don't have that issue.

Likely.

> but who knows?

It's all recorded in the wiki history, which you should be able to inspect (maybe only after you login).

> What I want to know is "Does your comment on incompatibility with Leopard really apply to Leopard only?"

Yes. That is why it says "Leopard Only"

> If so, it would be good to have a statement at the end of the paragraph warning about Leopard to the effect that Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite are not affected by this problem.

Isn't the fact that it says "Leopard Only" and "OS X Leopard" quite clear on that?

> My worry is that someone updated "Latest Releases" and modified the date without considering that the "Leopard Only" comment may not have been overtaken by the release of later versions. I can't install on Yosemite until I know the answer.

Nope.

Replying to akinnaird@…: re reply from jeremy hu
I will prepend my additional comments by "!!" - there is no indication as to how reply contributions are shown in messages. It doesn't seem to be as clear as in some other systems. (cf github).

!! I am surprised that your system did not notify me that there had been a reply to my message. I had to come back and look at the ticket independently to find there had been any activity. Bug C!

Sorry guys - I couldn't work out how to report my problem, so it's gone in here. It might be good to have some sort of feedback link for support or complaints that don't seem to be bug related. So that's bug A.
We have a link to the mailing lists on the very top of the navigation bar on the left.

!! Why should I think that being attached to a mailing list would have any bearing on reportng a problem? Mailing Lists are about receiving information, not giving it!

!! thank you - that's the answer to my original Bug B question.

and at the end of the page it certainly says "Last modified 2 months ago" but there is no indication of what was modified - probably "Latest Releases",
Likely.

!! Good - I'm glad we agree!

but who knows?
It's all recorded in the wiki history, which you should be able to inspect (maybe only after you login).

!! (I believe I was logged in!) And that was one of my problems - that the history was not clearly and unambiguously recorded.

What I want to know is "Does your comment on incompatibility with Leopard really apply to Leopard only?"
Yes. That is why it says "Leopard Only"
If so, it would be good to have a statement at the end of the paragraph warning about Leopard to the effect that Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite are not affected by this problem.
Isn't the fact that it says "Leopard Only" and "OS X Leopard" quite clear on that?

!! No - that's my main problem. That the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the history renders the whole document unreliable.

My worry is that someone updated "Latest Releases" and modified the date without considering that the "Leopard Only" comment may not have been overtaken by the release of later versions. I can't install on Yosemite until I know the answer.
Nope.

!! If you accept that everyone who updates these records is completely infallible then you could take that standpoint, but decades of experience in software engineering tell me otherwise.

!! My question has been answered (eventually!) a few paragraphs back.
!! I need to say that in all my professional career over the last several decades, and since the arrival of the internet in many similar web-based discussions I have had, I have never experienced a response quite so condescending and arrogant as this to my query. I f any moderators are covering this, they should have a discussion with Jeremy Hu as to his attitude.

!! Although I don't have any great confidence that the design of this reporting system will allow my comments to be passed to Jeremy Hu!

Oh - for God's sake!!! I clicked on "Preview" and having done that and noted a change I needed to make, could not get back into my comment to modify it! My major software expertise is in Human Interface design - lads, you need to get something better. Here follows the amended comment your system did not allow me to make. (Because I am too/stupid/unobservant/ignorant? Have you ever wondered why Steve Krug's best seller on web design is called "Don't Make Me Think"! I am not certain, but it looks as if your system has also stripped out all the newlines I deliberately placed in my comment to make it more readable. Come on - a newline is one character (or at most two) - why would you strip them now that computers tend to have more than 640KB RAM as standard? And Hey - I have to be impressed with the efficiency of your system - before I have completed my correction, the incorrect copy is up for all to read! I'm not going to bother previewing this - it'l only slow things down!

Having submitted that last correction, I see there's a button which apparently (top Right!) allows me to edit my submission. That's a Good Idea! Unfortunately, when I click it, it just tells me "Forbidden". I refer you to my previous comments on Human Interface Design.

Yes, trac sucks.

You are emailed when replies are sent.

When you click preview, it just renders out below the text field that you edit. You just need to scroll back up to edit.

You can reply to posts in a way that indents properly. See my initial comment to you.

The mailing list is for discussion, including general feedback and support.

I'm not sure why you think my response to you was condescending. I have reread it a few times to try to figure out why you interpreted it that way, and I just don't see it. I'm sorry you interpreted it that way. It was not intended as such.
