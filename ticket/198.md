Window doesn't show any content
===============================


I have used X11 on OS X 10.4.11 for installing database packages on Solaris or RHEL servers, with ssh and X11 forwarding.

Since I installed XQuartz 2.3.x on 10.5.5 the Java installer Window doesn't show any content anymore.

I don't know which part of X11 this problem is connected to, but the exact same Java installers works on 10.4.11 & X11 1.1.3 perfectly ok. The attachments contain screen captures of both environments.
