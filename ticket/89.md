focus remains in last space when switching spaces
=================================================


Seen with darwin 9.2.2 and XQuartz 2.2.0\_rc3 on a first gen Intel iMac with two displays and no custom ~/.xinitrc:

1.  Go to space 1.
2.  Quit X11.
3.  From Terminal.app do xlsclients to fire-up X11.
4.  X11 should be in the forground, do cmd-N to get a new xterm.
5.  Go to space 2 (I use a mouse squeeze for this).
6.  Use cmd-tab to get X11 to the foreground.
7.  cmd-N for another xterm which appears on space 2.
8.  Move that xterm so it has focus and is in the same place the other one is.
9.  Switch to space 1.
10. Type something, it ends-up in the xterm in space 2 not the one in space 1.

I see two differences here with how as an example Terminal.app behaves in
spaces:
In step 6 why do I not get transported back to space 1?
In step 10 why is the focus still in the space 2 xterm?
I actually like the behavior in step 6, maybe don't fix that :)

Ah! I see the problem! It's the cmd-tab that is the issue here. You should not see this now that cmd-tab works right.
