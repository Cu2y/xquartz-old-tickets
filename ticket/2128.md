Please provide resize arrows on all window edges
================================================


Please provide resize arrows and the ability to resize on all window edges, just like it is with any other non-X11 window.

Problem is that if the lower right handle is out of reach, which happens pretty often, you are screwed. Yes there might be workarounds, like maximizing a window. But e.g. maximizing itself is currently broken in a lot of cases as well, esp. with external screens... Having the ability to resize on all window edges would give users the possibility to get control over a window again in many cases. And it would be consistent with the rest of the OS... also you could get rid of this resize corner then.

OSX 10.10.2
XQuartz 2.7.7
