2.7.4 starts on marverick on port 6006?
=======================================


We are using 5 machines using xquartz to connect to an other x maschine an application is running.

Before migrate from 10.8 to 10.9 all xquartz started on port \*.6000 as listener.

But now I get the local xserver listening on port 6006?

I really have no idea how to change.

You can't make assumptions about what DISPLAY will be. Yes, there is a bug that the lock files are not removed which is why the DISPLAY number increases on subsequent runs. Please use this opportunity to fix the mis-assumption in your core rather than waiting for a fix to the lock file removal issue.
