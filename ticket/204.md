Record Extension Not Found
==========================


Record Extension removed in the current version of X11. Possible solution is an hidden command to enable it.

Alfredo, will you need the record extension to record mouse data while X11 is not the active OSX application? With 2.3.2, X11 only sends mouse events when X11 is in the foreground or when X11 is in the background and the mouse is over an X11 window. This was done to fix things like X11 tooltips appearing over a foreground app.

Check out xeyes id you're curious about what you'd be recording.

1.4.2-apple26 has an option to enable the RECORD extension.

Grab it from <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/X11-1.4.2-apple26.bz2> , then decompress, and replace /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 with the updated binary. You can then do:

defaults write org.x.X11 enable\_test\_extensions -boolean true

If you need the mouse movent reported while X11.app is in the background, I'll need to make further changes, so reopen this bug if that is the case.
