GLX crash 2.2.3
===============


Running 10.5.4 with 2.2.3 X11 crashes when the user double clicks on an X11 window. This behavior seems repeatable on his Mac. The speed of the double click seems to matter. I have a system trace attached. This is a Mac Pro with 8GB memory running Tecplot (locally) and Gridgen (display local running remote). The work-around is not to double click.

I have a related problem with the same kind of crashlog when DS Visualizer ( <http://accelrys.com/products/discovery-studio/visualization/discovery-studio-visualizer.html> ) run on a remote machine tries to show a 3D-view. 2.3.0-rc7 suffered from the same problem for me at least.

I attach my crash-dump as well.

I just tried with 2.3.1 and the problem is still there. I suppose you already knew but still...

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?
