export DISPLAY path changes with reboot
=======================================


I have installed XQuartz on my MacBook Air running OsX 10.9.1. I regularly ssh into an offsite computing farm to run jobs. I export my display settings in my .bashrc, for example right now I have:

export DISPLAY=/tmp/launch-tdM9KG/org.macosforge.xquartz:0

which works just fine. The problem comes which I need to reboot my machine. The directory changes and I am forced to modify my bash script in order to get my display to export correctly. The change is always in the launch-\#\#\#\#\#\# part of the path. This problem didn't not exist when I used the X11 terminal on my older macbook pro (mountain lion).

Don't do that.

Yeah, don't do that. Just use $DISPLAY as it is set in the environment.

If you set DISPLAY in .bashrc on ML, this "problem" certainly did exist there as well.
