New windows don't respect Apple Menu Bar on second display
==========================================================


Now that OS X Mavericks (I'm using 10.9.3) allows a second menu bar on a second (non-mirrored) display, I sometimes have the issue that a new X11 window will be opened on the second display, with its own title bar hidden underneath the Apple Menu Bar. In other words, the window is drawn from the upper left coordinates of the screen not accounting for the ~20 pixel offset of the Apple Menu Bar. I will attach an image of such an obscured window, and a second image of the same window after I turned on display mirroring.

Thanks for any help,
-Gene

I should have more carefully searched other bug reports first. I just found [\#⁠832](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/832), where it is stated that this will be fixed in XQuartz 2.7.7. Please go ahead and close this ticket (I do not see where I can do this myself). Apologies for the redundancy.
