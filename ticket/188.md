installer package && /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/ delete
===================================================


the problem stemming from this I expect has been mentioned before but here's the quick recap....
as I load (from terminal) x, xquartz, etc.... I get the following:

    Macintosh:~ gs$ x
    Xquartz: X11.app = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
    Xquartz: Starting X server: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 --listenonly
    X11.app: main(): argc=2
        argv[0] = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
        argv[1] = --listenonly
    Waiting for startup parameters via Mach IPC.
    X11.app: do_start_x11_server(): argc=1
        argv[0] = x
    Xquartz starting:
    X.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple17
    Build Date: 20080905
    No matching visual for __GLcontextMode with visual class = 3 (32772), nplanes = 24
    '''(EE) XKB: Couldn't open rules file /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/rules/base'''
    Quitting Xquartz...

looking at the "bolded" piece I tried to track down the problem...(I included the rest since I am not a developer and it may be relevant to the rest of you-- or they could possibly be issues also caused by.... whatever caused this problem) looked in directory:
/usr/X11/share/X11
did NOT find folder "xkb" at all~!!

tried reinstalling xquartz 2.3.1, while watching folder and watched it put in a folder labeled "xkb"-- but as the installer continued right before it said "finished" (presumably during a 'clean up phase') it deleted the folder.

I have a 1st gen MacBook Pro running 10.5.5.

> I really meant this to be helpful, I don't know how developers deal with bug reports etc.. forgive me if i messed anything up. thanks

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

That was intentional. It's not a bug. Installing the xkb stuff actually causes Xephyr and Xnest to not work.
