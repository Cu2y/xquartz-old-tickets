Menu bar over title bar, windows in upper left corner, after update
===================================================================


I'm running OS X 10.8.5. I had a flawless XQuartz 2.7.4 installation when I stupidly decided this morning to update XQuartz to 2.7.5. Now xterm windows are stuck in the upper left corner, they cannot be moved, the .Xresources file is not being read, starting any other window leads to the same location, same inability to move. I have removed all the X files in /opt, and in /Library/Lauch\* and unloaded the launch daemon from launchctl … I reinstalled the older 2.7.4, no change, still screwed up. What am I doing wrong? Where is this new behavior coming from? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *insufficient information*

Well nothing in 2.7.5 should be related to the issue you are reporting, and I can't really know more without a sysdiagnose from the problematic state.
