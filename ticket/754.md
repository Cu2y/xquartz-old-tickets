XQuartz 2.7.4 - print to pdf in OS X 8.3 gives a print error
============================================================


hi folks,

I've just installed XQuartz 2.7.4 (release) on my system (10.8.3 - details below).
I switch to TextEdit and got to Print a document; select pdf option, choose print, and I get a print error.
This is something I do several times a day, and I have never encountered a problem doing a pdf print.

I uninstalled XQuartz and the problem now remains.

any ideas?

OSX 10.8.3
MBP Retina
256 GB SSD drive
8 GB RAM

Are you setting DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH?

hi Jeremy.

I didn't configure anything, I just used the normal installer.

also, I've noted that this bug is closed; the problem still exists.

cheers

The reported issue is not possible. OS X frameworks do not make use of XQuartz. The only way this could potentially be possible is by mis-configuring your system using the DYLD\_ environment variables by following some online guide written by someone who doesn't understand what they're doing.

Please try running 'set | grep DYLD' in Terminal and seeing if that is the culprit. If it's not, you probably just had bad timing and incorrectly blamed XQuartz.

hi Jeremy,

as I say in my description, before I installed XQuartz and had no problem printing to pdf; immediately after installing XQuartz I could no longer print to pdf.
I ran the package installer, I didn't configure any settings, etc. on my system.

to uninstall XQuartz, I followed these instructions from ticket number 675:

Thank you for the information. Based on using lsbom, the uninstall instructions need to be modified for Mountain Lion and I have provided them immediately below this line.

    Uninstall Steps for Mountain Lion 10.8.2

    launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist
    sudo rm -rf /opt/X11* /Library/Launch*/org.macosforge.xquartz.* /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app /private/etc/*paths.d/*XQuartz
    sudo pkgutil --forget org.macosforge.xquartz.pkg

Did you check for your DYLD environment variables?
