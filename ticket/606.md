Why Did it Take 2 Times for XQuartz to Enable my GIMP Program?
==============================================================


Hello,

Could someone out there please explain why it took 2 uploads in order for my GIMP program to work?

Please use simple language, as I'm not that computer-literate.

Thanks,
Majortrout

This is a bug tracking system, not a support forum.

I don't really understand what you are asking, but I suggest you ask your question on GIMP's forums or mailing list.
