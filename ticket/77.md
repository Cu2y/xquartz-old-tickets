X11 Interface Freezes
=====================


I usually work on an external machine running xterms and other x apps through X11. Every so often, X11 freezes up on my and I can't access my open windows any more. I usually have 2 or 3 xterms open and xemacs. It seems to happen when I click quickly from xemacs to the xterm. I can't seem to make it happen repeatably.

When this happens, I try to quit X11, it hangs, then I force quit. Then I can fire it up again set everything up again. Not sure what else I can report out of logs, but I can post information when it happens again.

I'm calling it a crash above, although X11 is technically still running. The only way out is to kill it, so it essentially stops responding.

Can you please sample the Xquartz process when it hangs like this.

I get the same issue - clicking rapidly back and forth between two eterms replicates it for me. Process sample is attached.

I have the same. The only running X app is emacs, and it definately seems linked to clicking focus from one frame (X11 window) to another. I have had it freeze half a dozen times today, all during a focus change.

Attached are samples from X11.app quartz-wm and emacs

Interesting - it hasn't happened for days, but out of the blue it just happened again. No different work habit - docking/undocking my laptop (which often triggers screen resize issues with X11, but that's a different matter), clicking between multiple emacs frames.

It just decided it had had enough! More samples attached.

Sorry, I didn't see the request for more info. It looks like you got some samples from other people. I just updated to the most recent release, so I'll post if I see this issue again. (Is there a way to get updates on this ticket via email?)

Still seeing this problem with 2.2.0.1
