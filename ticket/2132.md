Maximize in Yosemite covers dock
================================


Using XQuartz 2.7.7 on Yosemite (10.10.3), double-clicking on the title bar should maximize an X11 application. When maximizing, XQuartz windows take up the full screen and ignore the dock. They should go only as low as the start of the dock to match the way standard Mac OS applications work.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Fixed*

I don't reproduce this in 2.7.8\_rc3. Possibly fixed by the menubar size changes.
