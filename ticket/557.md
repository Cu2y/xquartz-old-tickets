xterm -hold busyloops
=====================


running a command with -e causes the cpu to peg.
for instance, just check the cpu after this command:

xterm -display 192.168.1.7:0 -hold -e sleep 10

This isn't the case on linux. I found a very old bug report that seems related:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=116213>

I'm surprised this hasn't been addressed long ago!

Why would you be surprised? You're only reporting it now.

The Debian bug report states, "I put a fix for this in xterm patch [\#⁠162](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/162)" and we have a much newer version than that.

Please provide more information. What version of xterm and all of its libraries are you using (or what version of XQuartz is installed)? Does this happen with 2.7.2\_beta3? What OS do you have?

-   **Summary** changed from *xterm -hold -e causes 100% cpu load* to *xterm -hold busyloops*
-   **Version** set to *2.7.1 (xserver-1.11.4)*
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Nice to Have*
-   **Milestone** set to *later*

I can reproduce this, but seeing as how it's just with an obscure case and -hold doesn't really work well in general, it's not much of a priority. I'm not sure it'f it's libxcb, libXt, or xterm to blame.

select() is telling xterm that it can read on fd 4, but it gets nothing when it does:

    (gdb) list
    3746            FD_SET(ice_fd, &select_mask);
    3747    #endif
    3748        }
    3749        if (need_cleanup)
    3750            Cleanup(0);
    3751        i = Select(max_plus1, &select_mask, &write_mask, 0,
    3752               (time_select ? &select_timeout : 0));
    3753        if (i < 0) {
    3754            if (errno != EINTR)
    3755            SysError(ERROR_SELECT);

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
