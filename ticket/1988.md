repeating character in open xterm after quitting or ctl-d out of another window
===============================================================================


This happens relatively frequently, but I can't get it to happen consistently every time. I'll have several open xterm windows and ctl-d to close one. Then in another xterm window there will be a continuous "dddddddddddddddddd..." at the prompt that will continue until I go that window and stop it. This also happens sometimes in another setting. I'll be using an application called "xbsa" that make ball-and-stick figures of molecules. When I hit 'q' to close the xbsa window, then in the xterm I used to start xbsa, I get a continuing sequence of "qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq..." until I stop it. I have attached a pic of this behavior. Note, this has been happening for as long as I can remember.

Odd. I've never seen any other report about this.

Hmm. Doesn't seem like anyone else has this problem. Strange, since it has been happening for so long for me. If there is anything I could do to provide you with more information that might shed some light on it, let me know.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
