Error on launching The Gimp - "You have an existing ~/.xinitrc file"
====================================================================


I have OS X.5.4, Intel MacBook. When I upgraded from OS X.4 The Gimp no longer worked. So I downloaded and installed the latest version - 2.4.5. Then it said to install XQuartz 2.2. So I installed that. When I launched The Gimp I get an error message from X11 saying

"Alert You have an existing ~/.xinitrc file. Windows displayed by X11 applications may not have titlebars, or may look different to windows displayed by native applications. Would you like to move aside the existing file and use the standard X11 environment? Yes No"

But the Yes No buttons are not clickable (nothing happens on click). The Force Quit Applications window shows X11 (not responding), and Gimp. When I Force Quit X11 it shuts down for a few seconds, then reappears. I have to logout to get X11 to fully quit.

So even though the system shows The Gimp is running, when I switch to it the only menu showing is "Gimp" with no real options (Services, Hide, Quit).

I tried uninstalling the Gimp, and reinstalling XQuartz and then The Gimp. But I don't even know how to uninstall XQuartz. I had "Turn on X11 Focus Follows Mouse.app" installed for the previous version of The Gimp.

Thanks for any help...

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Priority** changed from *blocker* to *critical*
-   **Component** changed from *x11-apps* to *xserver*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.1*

I don't understand why you need a separate .app to toggle a single preference value (X11-&gt;Preferences has an option for focus follows mouse).

Can you please try starting X11 by itself (Not by starting gimp?)

What version of X11 do you have installed? Can you try 2.2.3?

And what is the URL for the version of gimp you are installing?

I got The Gimp from here : <http://darwingimp.sourceforge.net/download.html> - I used the first package MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) Intel.

In the description right under that it has a link for XQuartz 2.2 - <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/>

Can you please goto X11-&gt;About X11 and copy/paste the version string here... It should look something like:
XQuartz 2.3.0 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple5)

Thanks.

I wrote this while you were replying...

I have the "Turn on X11 Focus Follows Mouse.app" because I needed that under Mac OS 10.4 to run the previous version of The Gimp. When I upgraded to 10.5 The Gimp no longer worked, so I had to download the new version of The Gimp, and then XQuartz.

I actually do not know how to start X11 by itself. I do not see X11 or XQuartz anywhere. Oops - I see it now in Utilities. When I launch it nothing happens. No error, nothing. When I look at a list of running applications it is not there. When I highlight X11 it says it is Version 2.2.3. But when I Get Info on it, it says it is version 2.0, Copyright 2007 Apple inc. So that appears to be Apple's version? I don't know where XQuarz installed to. Would it be called X11 or XQuartz?

Thanks for your help...

Mike

X11 is in the utilities folder - and I cannot open it. See above for versions - 2.2.3 when I highlight X11.app, and version 2.0, Copyright 2007 Apple in the Get Info window.

So what happens when you type 'xterm' at the Terminal.app prompt? Can you open Console.app and copy/paste the relevant log portions corresponding to when X11.app tried to start?

Nothing much seems to happen when I type in xterm. The Terminal does not return a new line to type on, it just seems to pause. The window title of the terminal changes to "Terminal - xterm - 80 x 24"

The Console does not seem to display much either - mostly this every few seconds:
...g.x.startx\[458\]

But then just now that error message I first reported came up, only this time I was able to click on the "No" button. Then a bunch of stuff came up in the Console, and an X11 window opened up (title bar xterm). Looking at the About X11 - Xquartz 2.2.3.

This is what Console says (note that I had opened 3 Terminal windows to try running xterm):

8/5/08 9:59:39 PM org.x.startx\[458\] giving up.

Now let me start The Gimp just to see...

Gimp opens, but just with that one menu ("Gimp") that allows you to ... no, wait. Finally The Gimp has fully opened. Wow, that was all very slow. Let me try again to make sure... OK, it worked. I launched X11, and it opened. Then I launched The Gimp and it opened - both quickly.

Then I just tried opening The Gimp directly, without X11 first. It worked quickly also. Hmmm.

I don't know what to say. But thanks for helping me.

I just logged out and logged back in and tried starting The Gimp. It worked without a problem. I have no idea why.

Whatever is above the "8/5/08 9:59:39 PM org.x.startx\[458\] giving up." in the log is important. Can you please copy that here... also, put your log inside of ` ` so it is easy to read in trac.

Thanks.

I ran a query on the Console, but for some reason it returns nothing before 10:03:23 pm yesterday. If I remember correctly though, that line that I quoted was repeated a number of times before (same text, different \[number\]. Here is the log from today when I started Gimp.

I know, not very helpful to have a log for when it goes right...but I am not sure how to retrieve the log for the time you need. By the way - it is still working...

Thanks,

So this is really the critical line that catches my eye:

    8/5/08 10:05:28 PM org.x.startx[881] xauth: (stdin):2:  unknown command "76369f476cd2fdee823c898f0f7946cf" 

This is coming from one of these places in /usr/X11/bin/startx:

    xauth -q << EOF 
    add $displayname . $mcookie
    EOF

    or

    xauth -q -f "$xserverauthfile" << EOF
    add :$dummy . $mcookie
    EOF

Can you add some debugging echos to /usr/X11/bin/startx to figure out why you're giving bad data to xauth (and as a workaround for now, you can just disable xauth in X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Security
