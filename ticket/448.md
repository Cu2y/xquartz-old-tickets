xmodmap -e "add Control = Control\_R" fails (so does "add Mod1 = Meta\_L Meta\_R")
==================================================================================


macbookpro mid-2010, macosx-10.6.4, xquartz-2.5.3
(with option keys send Alt\_L and Alt\_R in preferences).

i'm getting errors when trying to set modifier keys using xmodmap.

the following xmodmap commands make:

-   the left alt key become Meta\_L (instead of Alt\_L), and
-   the right alt key becomes Control\_R (instead of Alt\_R).
-   then the control modifiers are cleared and set to the left and right control keys, and
-   the mod1 modifiers are cleared and set to be the left and right meta keys.

<!-- -->

     keycode 66 = Meta_L NoSymbol Meta_L
     keycode 69 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R
     clear Control
     add Control = Control_L Control_R
     clear Mod1
     add Mod1 = Meta_L Meta_R

i get an error (BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)) in the add commands with Control\_R and Meta\_L and Meta\_R. the Control\_L on its own is accepted.

it works with the X11.app that comes with macosx-10.6.4 (xquartz-2.3.5).

I'm posting this here as a PSA for anyone else who runs into this issue, as I just did. I had just switched from X11.app to XQuartz (I finally got around to upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion) and my .Xmodmap stopped working because of this exact same error, though I was getting it when trying to Control to Control\_L.

After lots of poking and prodding, I finally worked out that the issue seems to be related to other modifiers still bound to the key you're trying to add a modifier to. In my case, it turned out that Mod2 was already applied to the key I mapped to Control\_L. Adding a "clear Mod2" command near the beginning of my .Xmodmap resolved the issue.

As a reminder: you can see which modifiers are bound to which keys by running xmodmap with no arguments.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
