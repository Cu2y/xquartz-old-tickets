can not launch XQuartz
======================


Hi,
I am using Mac Os 10.6.8 and this is my error message when I am trying to launch Xquartz:

dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib

> Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
> Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 14.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 10.0.0

Thanks in advance

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.1*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

You are probably setting DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.
