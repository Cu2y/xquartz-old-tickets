keyboard mapping broken using ssh -X
====================================


Using XQuartz 2.7.4 and Mountain Lion 10.8.2 I'm having the same keyboard mapping problems found in this ticket:
<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/471>

I can open the terminal and keys are mapped correctly. I run the command ssh -X root@asdfcomputer and login my commands are still input correctly. I'm sshing to this machine for the explicit purpose of running virt-manager and when I do the program loads up fine and my mapping even works there. Moving forward I load a virtual machine inside the virt-manager and within the virtual machine is where the mapping fails to the same mapping mentioned in ticket 471.

Maybe this isn't a bug within XQuartz but can anyone help?

Yeah, it seems as though this is not an X11 bug. My guess is that "virt-manager" assumes the keymap matches the machine it is running on and not what X11 is using.
