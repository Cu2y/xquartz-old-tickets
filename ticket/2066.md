-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

Not sure what you're trying to do there, but I don't see a problem. The reported error is valid. If you need help, I suggest you ask on this mailing list.

Begging your pardon, but there is a problem: XQuartz aborts - a window pops up briefly (so briefly I can't read it) in the dock then vanishes. Terminal then says:
err:systray:initialize\_systray Could not create tray window
Application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded.
Make sure that your X server is running and that $DISPLAY is set correctly.

Wine was working perfectly in 10.6.8 with Apple's X11 before the upgrade to Yosemite required that I shift to XQuartz

Well none of that was mentioned in the report. Your report shows you trying to execute a socket which of course fails and then you say "wine fails of course" ... wine seems to work perfectly fine.

"err:systray:initialize\_systray" is not something related to XQuartz.

Please take this to the x11-users mailing list for assistance.

If your version of wine is using old libraries, you should update them. XQuartz 2.7.6 and later work on Yosemite, and MacPorts libxcb has had the necessary changes since the summer.
