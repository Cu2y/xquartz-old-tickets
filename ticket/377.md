No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding Problem
========================================================================


This worked fine until this release 2.5.0 - now some of my X11 apps do not draw borders correctly or display scroll bars when using SSH to log in to CENTOS machines - this makes focus difficult in Landmark Graphics ProMAX software difficult(commercial Seismic Data Processing System).

**ssh -Y and ssh -X give the following error on login.
**

**Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.**

-   **Priority** changed from *major* to *trivial*
-   **Milestone** set to *OSX*

This has nothing to do with X11. It's an issue in ssh. We're going to "fix" this in ssh by having it not print the message when you're using the launchd DISPLAY socket.

The reason for this message is that there is no xauth data for the launchd socket by design (it's already a secure connection).
