xterm problem : Korean file name does not display correctly (broken Korean file name)
=====================================================================================


Hello,

I am reporting a xterm problem
I'm using the latest XQuartz (2.7.7). I am using Korean Mac OSX (10.10.2). When I do 'ls' in xterm, the Korean file name does not display correctly (broken Korean file name). But it is OK in linux (Fedora, Redhat).

Could you fix the problem in the next version?

Many thanks!

Not an XQuartz bug. If anything, this is an xterm bug or a font issue.
