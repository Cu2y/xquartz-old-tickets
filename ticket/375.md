REGRESSION: Cannot drag X11 windows from one space to another
=============================================================


An X11 window cannot be dragged off the edge of the desktop and into an adjacent space.

Dragging and simultaneously using control-\# also fails. More specifically, if I drag an X11 window in Space 1 and do control-2, I'm switched to Space 2 but the X11 window remains in Space 1. I can use the mouse freely in Space 2, but if I switch back to Space 1 the cursor is "glued" to that X11 window. Until I click to release it, the X11 window is held and moves with the mouse.

This problem exists on my MacBook3,1 running OS X 10.6.3 and XQuartz 2.5.1\_beta1 (xorg-server 1.8.0). It does not seem to exist on my MacPro4,1 running OS X 10.6.3 and XQuartz 2.5.0
