apps cant be moved between monitors
===================================


On a Mac running Mavericks with multiple monitors, X11 apps can't be drug between monitors. The mouse pointer moves but the X11 app disappears.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

Discussed the problem and workaround on multiple other bug reports as well as the x11-users mailing list. The underlying problem is not something addressable in XQuartz alone. Please file a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com>
