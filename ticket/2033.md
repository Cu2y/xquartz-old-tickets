XQuartz off-screen with multiple monitors - workaround to get it back
=====================================================================


This is not a bug report, but I don't know where else to post this where people with this problem will see it.

I use anywhere from 1 (laptop) to four (laptop + hdmi + thunderbolt + usb) monitors when I work, and I need to use meld to do code reviews. The issue is that when I start up xquartz in any of the configurations, when I plug/unplug any of my monitors, xquartz disappears from my screen and I can't get it back. My only solution so far has been to figure out which configuration I last started it up with last, and then re-arrange my monitors to match. Which, if I'm on the road, means I'm basically screwed.

I know the root cause is an apple issue, and I've scoured the net to find a fix but nothing has worked for me until I figured this out. I realized that somewhere on my mac, the startup top/left coordinates are being saved. If I could just figure that out, I could reset the position. Well, I didn't. However, I DID find that if I remove ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist and then startup meld, the xquartz now appears properly using whatever configuration I happen to have at the moment. I don't know what is kept in here and other people might not be able to do this, but this work-around works consistently for me.

Just thought I'd share it with the community as I can't find anyone else who has discovered this.

Window placement of X11 windows is controlled by the WM (specifically quartz-wm), not Apple's Window Manager.

What in the plist is causing you problems? You should try deleting specific keys rather than the whole thing. As far as I can tell there's nothing in there that should impact where your X11 windows get placed.
