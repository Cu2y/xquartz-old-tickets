Hang with beachball at startup
==============================


On one occasion, on starting up X (2.3.2\_rc1) I got the X background with a beachball cursor. The only way I found to get out of it was to log in from another machine and kill X11.app. alt-apple-a did not work.

I haven't yet been able to reproduce it.
