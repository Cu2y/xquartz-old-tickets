Impossible to avoid automatic update
====================================


Hi,

That's not really a bug, but i want to install XQuartz with the new Gimp 2.8 in our classrooms. I make an installation which will be ok for the next school year. I can avoid to be informed for the next release (2.7.2 rc3), but there is no possibility to avoid all updates after 2.7.1. Or i'm wrong ?
I don't want that students see the window for updating XQuartz in 2 or 3 months.

Is it possible to avoid all updates ? It will be very useful for us

Thanks in advance

Christian

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

You should really use the x11-users mailing list for things that are not bugs ;)

I believe you can do this as the user:

    defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.x11 SUEnableAutomaticChecks -boolean NO

Or I think you can add a SUEnableAutomaticChecks key to XQuartz's Info.plist to disable it as well.
