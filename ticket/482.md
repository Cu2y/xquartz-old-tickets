XQuartz aborts with "Could not unlock window XX after drawing."
===============================================================


Xquartz 2.5.3 is reasonably stable for me. Anything newer is not.
2.6.2 did appear to improve matters, where the server will now run a day or two at a time before crashing, whereas earlier ones would crash within 30 seconds of use. Nonetheless, I'm running 2.5.3 again, because stable is important for keeping this laptop in one piece.

I am attaching the crash logs I have, which are all 2.6.2.

Try the fix in [\#⁠463](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/463) and reopen (with new crash logs) if that doesn't help.

If you can provide a binary, I'd be happy to test it. I'm probably not in the position to do a build. I'll wait for a release if I have to.

Yes, please follow the instructions to install the binary as detailed in bug [\#⁠463](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/463) (X11.bin-PR-463)

Server won't start with that. Overlaying it into a 2.6.2 install. Will attach a crashlog from that momentarily.

-   **Summary** changed from *xquartz &gt; 2.5.3 -&gt; crash, crash, crash* to *XQuartz aborts with "Could not unlock window XX after drawing."*
-   **Version** set to *2.6.0 (xserver-1.9.3)*
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Expected*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.0*

This isn't a crash, and if it was reported during the 2.6.3 rc period, it would've been fixed in yesterday's release, but it's too late for that now... you'll have to either build your own server binary with the "fix" or wait for a 2.7.x beta.

This is an assertion. It was added about a year ago to catch unbalanced locking:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=5d1d9d9ae39fab2ee2ac085f9776f82768828dc8>

So far, it looks like you're the only one to have triggered this, so I'm curious exactly what about your workflow or the applications you're running do to poke this. Any insight you can provide will be helpful.

The assertion is removed and replaced with a warning now, but I'm keeping this open to figure out why we're seeing this.

I have finite time to debug, especially considering that I have to spend about an hour of setup work after an x server crash. So no, I didn't get to test your rc for you.

Anyway. Most of what I'm doing consists of Xquartz's xterm and a couple of emacsen of different vintages (23.x, 20.7 largely). Possibly a gitk on screen at the time of the crash.

Ok, well there's unfortunately not much to go on there. But a workaround for this issue will be in 2.7.0.

Hi,

I'm having a similar issue with my configuration. I don't know if it's the same bug but the crash log seams similar (but I can't say I'm used to read these so...) The only difference is that it can occur anytime after lauching xquartz. I had it within 4 minutes as well as after 3 hours. (And I'm not running xquartz for more than 6 hours)

Anyway, the only application I'm using on my xquartz server is dlight (<http://www.nicole-banana.com>) and I did not found a way to reproduce the crash which seems to be hazardous.

Hope it can help...

-   **Status** changed from *reopened* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Yep, that's the same bug. I'm baffled as to how you got there. I'm just going to close this since the workaround is in 2.7.0 (if it's not in beta1, it'll be in the next one).
