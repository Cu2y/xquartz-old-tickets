can't double click on trackpad
==============================


PowerBook G4 10.5.5 X11(Xquartz) updated to 2.3.1

In X11 apps (Gnucash, Gimp) I can't double click using my trackpad. I have to use the button. Single-click, click-drag, two-fingered scroll, and two-fingers for right-click all work fine. Double click works elsewhere.

I don't know enough to know which component this is actually occurring in, so I've left the default.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.2*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

1) X11 doesn't know about double clicks. It tells the client about clicks and the time they occurred
2) OSX doesn't do "touch the trackpad to click" (that I'm aware of)

If you have some driver which lets you tap to click, then you just need to tap faster so that GTK tells gimp that it's a double click.
