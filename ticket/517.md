Mouse locks to the right (Or another position) while playing games on Wine with XQuartz
=======================================================================================


Is "almost" the same bug as <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/498>, it was fixed on XQuartz 2.7.0 beta 2 but the same behavior appeared in XQuartz 2.7.0 beta 3 and rc1, I have tried with Wine 1.3.31, Wine 1.3.15 and the stable Wine version (1.2.3) but the behavior is still there.

Versions prior XQuartz 2.6.2 (XQuartz 2.6.1 and earlier) don't have this problem.

Anyway, thanks for developing XQuartz, is a very useful software for mac.

With Quake2 as an example, wine 1.3.17 and before work flawlessly. With beta2, mouse motion doesn't "stop". It's as if motion is determined by a delta from center and the mouse controls the sample point.

With beta3 and rc1, any mouse motion just makes the view go berserk.

Yep, installed Quake 2 and the behavior appeared, with Wine 1.3.15 + XQuartz beta 2, worked fine, with Wine 1.3.31 + XQuartz beta 2, worked fine with no issues, but when installing XQuartz beta 3 or RC1, the issue appears, with both versions of Wine.

Maybe is something wrong with raw mouse events (Or any xinput mouse events) support on rc1

No, quake2 fails with beta2 and the newer wine, but it fails differently. Try moving your mouse up a little bit then not touching the mouse. Your view will continue to move despite your stopping the mouse.

Ok, I'm gonna uninstall RC1, install beta 2, and try Quake 2 with Wine 1.3.31, thanks

Yeah, mouse is very laggy and keeps moving if you release it, so what is next step to do???

Well now, we need to bisect the server to figure out what changed it from broken style [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1) to broken style [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2) in hopes that this will give some insight into what the underlying problem is.

I looked in WineHQ page of Quake II (<http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=707&iTestingId=45597>)

    Mouse aiming
    by Evgeny on Wednesday April 20th 2011, 11:58
    Hello. 
    Just updated wine from 1.2.something to 1.3.18. With the previous version Quake 2 (v. 3.21) was running just fine. But with the recent one in-game mouse movement is ugly: while I move mouse aim moves respectively, but when I stop moving mouse aim begins it's own stick-slip motion. 
    Can someone help me?

Also is needed to set Wine sound mode to sound emulation.

Looks like we need to test with another game, I will try with Quake 3 and Counter-Strike, these works OOB on Wine and Mac

Yeah, I just brought up quake2 in wine on my linux machine, and it behaves exactly the same way as it does in XQuartz. That's a shame. I want to figure out how to fix that, but in the interim, it's not a bug in XQuartz, so we need to move on to figure out how to solve this issue.

Steam was giving me issues just launching under wine on linux.

I need a free test case that shows off the issue you are facing.

Also, if you can bisect to figure out which commit introduced the problem, that would be helpful. ac2c307f4716ebd3e955c004ceec9f4c029401a0 was the commit that fixed your other bug, so make sure that version works for you. a1d638da0d12c82c944bfecb996903210879f426 was the version that shipped with rc1. There aren't that many changes between the two, so it shouldn't take that long to bisect.

Hey!, I detected the commit that was causing the mouse problem (dix: don't XWarpPointer through the last slave anymore (<a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/517" class="missing ticket">#⁠38313</a>) - bbe6a69da398dba93679c23c3c50f9916cb562ca ), I have compiled the previous commit (2e28ff155ffc30707d42d885d5f6fc891bc82252 - Disable check of double-aligned in test/input.c on Renesas SH) and the mouse worked fine (I tested with Worms 2, because Counter-Strike and Quake III didn't open, because Coreaudio Driver in Wine is incomplete in 1.3.31)

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

This commit has been reverted from the 1.11 branch. It is still in master, but that should be addressed when whot has some time to investigate. That issue will be tracked here:
