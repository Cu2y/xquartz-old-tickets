Monoprice tablet sends events as cursor (probably NSUnknownPointingDevice)
==========================================================================


I switched to a new Monoprice \[UC-Logic\] tablet recently. It works perfectly in non-Xquartz apps \[Seashore and ArtRage as well as the system pen panel\], but in programs running through Xquartz it cannot make strokes. It can click menus and UI, but any lines I try to make on the canvas \[In both GIMP and MyPaint\] do not appear. Changing both the pen and Xquartz virtual pointer to "disabled" mode allows the tablet to be used as a mouse, but no pressure sensitivity is recognized.

Furthermore, when testing input events \[and the pen mode set to screen\] the only events recognized on the Monoprice tablet are "Enter" and "Leave", no button presses or motion events. When set to disabled, motion and button presses are noticed, but pressure is still not recorded.

I can attach any screeshots/casts or provide more system information if necessary. I use Xquartz-based art programs daily so I am very interested in getting this fixed.

It's not a matter of being supported by XQuartz or not. XQuartz just listens for NSEvents that contain the tablet data. You need to get it working with OS X. Once it's working with OS X, XQuartz will use it.

Ok, based on the x11-users email chain, it looks like this is a bug in the tablet's driver. Events are being sent as the cursor device which makes me think that the device is probably using NSUnknownPointingDevice as its pointingDeviceType when we get an NSTabletProximityEventSubtype. If that's the case, we can work around it by adding a defaults option to switch how NSUnknownPointingDevice is handled. It's currently treated as NSCursorPointingDevice, but we can give the user the option of using NSPenPointingDevice instead.

I need to get 2.7.4 out to address a critical issue seen in OS X 10.8.2 and 10.7.5, so deferring everything that is not a regression.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
