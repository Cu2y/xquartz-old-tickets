SnowLeopard installer for 2.5.0 states that it is a replacement for the \*Leopard\* X11
=======================================================================================


In the first screen after starting the installer, the title says "Install XQuartz 2.5.0 (SnowLeopard)", and the contents say "Welcome to the XQuartz 2.5.0 (SnowLeopard) Installer", but the contents of the pane directly below that states:

This is a community supported update to the version of X11 shipped with Mac OS-X Leopard. Please visit <http://xquartz.macosforge.org> for more information.

Note that that pane says that this is a replacement for the "Leopard" X11. Just thought you might wanna normalize that next time you're playing in the installer.

As always, thanks for all the great work, Jeremy!
