AIGLX: XQuartz 2.2.3 crash when managing multiple OpenGL rendering contexts
===========================================================================


Large application with Motif GUI causes XQuartz crash when managing multiple OpenGL rendering contexts. Reported to Apple - Apple Bug Tracker ID \# 5979038.

The XQuartz carsh looks to be the same as your ticket [\#⁠135](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/135).

Summary:
A large X11/Motif based application has multiple windows where
OpenGL w/GLX API is used to do graphics rendering. One window along
with it's Motif GUI panel is dismissed. When attempting to make this
window visible again, we crash.

We see also similar, but intermittent, crashes
when exiting the application.

We don't crash if our application is run under gdb. We \*do\* crash
if our application is started and gdb is subsequently
attached. Couldn't find a reliable way to repeat this crash until
recently and a hanging problem was eliminated by upgrading to X11 2.2.1.
The crashing goes back for several version of X11.

Notes:
Previously reported this crash as part of bug <a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/140" class="missing ticket">#⁠5853028</a>.

Crash logs indicate we're trying to set the OpenGL context
from the window manager. Running in X sync mode was no help.
Inserting glFinish calls prior to glxMakeCurrentContext was
no help.

A crash log of X11 is attached below. Here's a gdb tracenback of
our app...

From email:

This has not been a problem for a while. We discovered removing a setting of LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_INDIRECT would avoid the crashing. We were setting this variable as a workaround for a problem with a Power Mac release of our product.

...

So this may still be an issue with AIGLX, but since it's \*just\* AIGLX, it's not as high a priority right now...

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?

I'm seeing a possibly related crash in Wine 1.1.15 with Xquartz 2.3.3 beta1. Wine uses multiple OpenGL contexts as well as sharing display lists, so this could also be related to bug report [\#⁠196](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/196). The crash I'm seeing occurs in glMakeCurrent/glXMakeCurrent, and occurs with vanilla Wine code and the Xquartz-provided 2.3.3 beta1 disk image.

Can you tell me if the AIGLX changes in 2.4.1\_alpha1 have fixed this issue for you?
