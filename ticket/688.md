xterm/rxvt text and background colors change in intensity on resize/selection when manipulated on an external monitor
=====================================================================================================================


This appears to be the same problem as referenced in this ticket:

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/425>

The saturation level of text increases once it has been highlight, if the window has been resized, or if another window is dragged overtop the given xterm window. This is also true of the terminal background color. The original colors can be restored by dragging the xterm onto the built-in display and back. It appears that the color change happens anytime the window is redrawn on the external display. See the attached screenshot and system profile for reference.

-   **Milestone** set to *later*

I seem to recall a fixed bug with color profiles at some point over the past year or so. Is this still an issue?

I still see this bug every day. It happens with my xterm and emacs windows. I don't have a specific set of steps to reproduce it. It just seems to happen randomly. Every once in a while, the grey background becomes lighter when I switch back to the space I run XQuartz in. If the text in the window updates, it fixes the background color.

One other thing: I run fvwm with the pager instead of Quartzwm. Often the discolored regions match windows on other fvwm desktops.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
