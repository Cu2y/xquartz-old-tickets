XQuartz 2.4.0 problems with Biggles
===================================


Using either a direct install of the graphics program biggles (current version, <http://sourceforge.net/projects/biggles/>) or the Macports install of the same, I get the error, triggered by the biggles command plot.show():

Error: Unresolved inheritance operation

When I reinstalled the standard OSX 10.5.8 x11 via the combo update, the error disappeared.

That crash you mentioned is completely unrelated.

Can you try with the latest version? I haven't been releasing betas for Leopard, so you'll need to build it yourself on MacPorts (sudo port -v install xorg-server). Then just launch /Applications/MacPorts/X11.app

I checked again and the direct biggles install actually crashes Python 2.5, so just take the Macports install as the origin of the problem. Macports installs its own x11 code when installing other applications, but biggles calls both that code and the Xquartz x11 saerver via /usr/bin

I'll try the macports xorg-server install as you suggest and report back.

A question: port info xorg-server gives the result: xorg-server @1.7.2 (x11, devel) which doesn't sound like it's version 2.5.0

Am I misunderstanding things or is there a way to access the latest version?

Incidentally, I don't currently show xorg-sever installed under macports (port installed name:<sup>x),\\ might\\ that\\ explain\\ the\\ whole\\ problem?

sudo port -v install xorg-server

Install broke.

Your Xplugin.h is newer than your libXplugin because you used the combo update over 2.4.0.

Install XQuartz 2.4.0 to get the newer libXplugin, then install xorg-server from MacPorts.

2.4.0 and 2.5.0 are package versions. The server versions are the 1.x versions.

Yes, I had to reninstall the 10.5.8 combo install over top of XQuartz 2.4.0, because the XQuartz 2.4.0 server broke the py26-biggles Macports install.

I'll try as you suggest.

OK, after I reinstalled XQuartz 2.4.0, xorg-server installed properly using Macports, but py26-biggles is broken again for the test programs on the Biggles sourceforge site:

$ python bigglestest1.py
Error: Unresolved inheritance operation

My suspicion is that biggles is using the XQuartz x11 server, which is what I think caused the problem last time, and necessitated reinstalling the OSX 10.5.8 combo update.

See thread at <http://www.mail-archive.com/macports-users@lists.macosforge.org/msg17579.html>

A possible solution might be to get py26-biggles to use the Macports-installed xorg-server, but how do I do that?

biggles will use whichever X11 server you are running. Are you running /Applications/Utilities/X11.app or /Applications/MacPorts/X11.app ? The former is from xquartz.macosforge.org.

I have both installed. If I run the Macports version (2.5.0) before running Python and biggles, the XQuartz version (2.4.0) opens and is the server used by biggles. How do I either set 2.5.0 as the default, remove 2.4.0, or get Python to run biggles using 2.5.0?

The 2.4.0 version is starting because your DISPLAY variable is pointing to the launchd socket that is for the 2.4.0 version (that is default). You need to start an xterm from MacPorts X11 and run it from there if you want to run it in that server or change your configuration so launchd uses the MacPorts X11 server.

I have installed py26-biggles. Please attach your bigglestest1.py

Sorry to be dumb, but how do I change my config to get launchd to use tge Macports x11 server?

OK, I did run the Macports x11, opened an xterm, and tried to run the bigglestest program, same error message.

FWIW, the line in the bigglestest program that triggers the error invokes the biggles command plot.show()

Running otool on plot shows three /usr/lib files on which plot depends:

This might be relevant: ticket <a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/337" class="missing ticket">#⁠19576</a>:

<http://trac.macports.org/ticket/19576>

Same error for 'nedit', required a recompile. This one probably requires a recompile of plotutils (at a guess).

Your test code works fine for me with the latest betas of 2.5.0.
