quartz-wm should support window type flags
==========================================


The Extended Window Manager Hints defines a \_NET\_WM\_WINDOW\_TYPE setting. You can use it to mark a window as a palette window or to disable resizing etc. It appears as if quartz-wm is completely ignoring these flags and always adds the standard three button title bar (or none at all).

This would help support wine and proably also GIMP and a lot of other apps.

Hrm, seems disabling resizing is a separate setting: \_NET\_WM\_ALLOWED\_ACTIONS. Suppose it'd be nice if they all were supported though. :)

-   **Type** changed from *feature request* to *usability*
-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.5.2 (xserver-1.8)*
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Nice to Have*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.0*

These are supported. What problems are you seeing with their implementation? Can you give me a reduced test case which shows off the misbehavior? Here is a list of all the supported atoms:

    static const char *net_wm_supported[] = {
        "_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW",
        "_NET_CLIENT_LIST",
        "_NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING",
        "_NET_CLOSE_WINDOW",
        "_NET_SUPPORTED",
        "_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_CLOSE",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_HORZ",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_VERT",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_MOVE",
        "_NET_WM_ACTION_RESIZE",

        "_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ",
        "_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT",
        "_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL",

    };
