Autoupdate from 4-&gt;5 crashed on my G4 Laptop
===============================================


While auto upgrading on my Laptop - the running X11 crashed. I'm reporting this so I can post the crash dump.

I'd pressed Install and Relaunch.

The installation proceeded normally and the new version is now running.

I tried this on my Imac G5 - and got another crash. I clicked on Ignore - but the installation didn't proceed.

Interesting, both of these are in:

I'm going to make a new binary for you to test which has more debugging output. To trigger the update, all you should need to do is edit /A/U/X11.app/Contents/Info.plist and change the '2.4.1' back to '2.4.0' in CFBundleVersion.

Did you do the update immediately after launch? I wonder if this is some kind of race. I saw this a few times while testing, but it went away once things started "working" and I assumed the problem was in my failure to setup Sparkle right.

Yes - I just did a continuous sequence - allowing each stage to complete and 'settle'.

Let me know when you want to me try.

I'm able to reliably trigger a crash using the "Check For Updates" and clicking on the "Applications" menu when the [ChangeLog](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/ChangeLog) is shown. gdb says that this new crash is happening as a result of:

\[window\_separator menu\];

in validateMenuItem. This same call appears in set\_window\_menu\_check.. so my guess is that these issues are related... I just have absolutely no idea why this call would be a problem... =/

      NSMenu *b = [x11_about_item menu];
      NSMenu *e = [apps_separator menu];
      NSMenu *f = [toggle_fullscreen_item menu];
      NSMenu *a = [dock_window_separator menu];
      NSMenu *d = [window_separator menu];

If I do all of these, only the last one (window\_separator) causes a problem...

I think I figured out the problem... not sure the fix though...

The Sparkle window wants to add itself to our Window menu... and that ends up breaking us.. =/

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

This should be fixed with:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?h=023cef31bbb2ab80a241098d82fcfd35ada75fc0&id=27ac5135267be9cb221329ae68461117dd43a4bf>

which is in 2.4.0\_rc1
