GIMP Windows stay in front
==========================


The GIMP three "control" windows always remain in front of everything else (that includes other X11 windows, other applications, and the GIMP images windows).

This problem has appeared with the upgrade of GIMP to 2.6 (and 2.6.1). The bug was reported to the GIMP (<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=556337>) however they claim that it is a problem with how the server handles windows and not a GIMP issue.

With the upgrade to 2.6 the GIMP made several windows into Utility windows and it is clear that XQuartz is not handling them the way that the GIMP expects. I am not sure if there is a standard for how these windows should be handled. It does seem odd to me that X11 should put windows in front that can't be moved behind other windows at all and that is how XQuartz is behaving. But perhaps that is intentional?

When it comes to different pieces of software interacting it is easy to point fingers and hard to track down the actual cause, but hopefully there is a standard somewhere that is or is not being followed?

-   **Milestone** set to *SnowLeopard*

This is a bug outside of X11 that won't be fixed before SnowLeopard.

This being the case, where exactly does the bug lie and is it reported and trackable? I assume that this is a window manager issue?

No, it is an issue that lies outside of X11 completely. The issue is with Dock/Spaces/WindowManager. If you have ADC membership, I urge you to test out the next ADC seed of SnowLeopard when it becomes available to see if that helps your situation.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** changed from *SnowLeopard* to *2.4.0*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

This should actually be fixed in 2.4.0\_rc1 when installed on 10.5.7
