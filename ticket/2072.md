crash app
=========


HI,
I have an error when i launch my apps (SIEMENS NX 9.0) when I open the app, I can see her on the dock with X11 but 3 seconds after she's left...
I open the diagnostic console and it wrote :
mdworker :
clio encountered an error (3) scanning : */Users/....../Siemens/NX Learning Edition90/history.pax*

com.apple.xpc.launchd : (com.siemens.plm.nx.119596(18200) ) Service exited with abnormal code :1

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

This seems to have nothing to do with XQuartz.
