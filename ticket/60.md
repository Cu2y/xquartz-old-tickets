Strange white rectangles over fonts in Inkscape
===============================================


Hi, I'm using x11 2.1.3 installed on OS X Leopard. When I open Inkscape I get white rectangles with black borders instead of fonts. Does anyone know how to fix this?

No response... closing...

Probably fixed in 2.2.0.1 with new font\_cache.sh ... if it's not, please reopen
