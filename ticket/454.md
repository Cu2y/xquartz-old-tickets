X11 is unable to set 256 colors
===============================


When I run some games using wine I get this error:
err:x11settings:X11DRV\_ChangeDisplaySettingsEx No matching mode found 640x480x8 @0! (NoRes)
Here demo app: <http://download.cnet.com/Knights-and-Merchants-demo/3000-7564_4-10019914.html>
The 8-bit mode is still in the system since (SwitchResX) is able to set it and read on apple's web page that it's not available for the end user but application should be able to use it.

Setting color mode to 256 colors causes following errors:

    err:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo  couldn't initialize OpenGL, expect problems
    err:d3d_caps:WineD3D_CreateFakeGLContext Can't find a suitable iPixelFormat.
    err:d3d:InitAdapters Failed to get a gl context for default adapter

Besides it is not the solution since the problem is that X11 doesn't make 8-bit mode available to other apps. Moreover this 8-bit mode it's only being set for X11 app and this is probably why OpenGL initialization didn't work.
When I did set manually (using SwitchResX) screen mode to 640x480 and 256 colors depth I didn't get such errors.

OpenGL doesn't use PseudoColor, so OpenGL will \*NEVER\* work with 256 color mode. That is not something anyone will ever be interested in fixing. If you're using OpenGL, you should be using TrueColor.

> Moreover this 8-bit mode it's only being set for X11 app

Right. That seems like what you wanted. If you want it set for all OS-X Applications, that's not an X11 issue...

If you have a workaround with "SwitchResX", I suggest you continue to use that.
