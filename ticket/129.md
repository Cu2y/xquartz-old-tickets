xterm does not appear but runs at 100% CPU on X11 start
=======================================================


Hi- I have a fresh install of OSX 10.5.3 on my Intel Mac Pro and installed Xquartz 2.2.2 (never installed the Leopard X11). I have a .xinitrc file in my home space to start a couple of xterms. When I click the X11.app icon to start X, most of the time I get only one of my xterms appearing on the screen. The other never appears, but is evidently running at 100% CPU usage as seen in the activity monitor. How do I get this misbehavior to stop? I apologize if this is simply in error in my .xinitrc. I paste below the contents of my .xinitrc

\#\#\#.xinitrc
cd $HOME
xterm -sb -sl 1000 -fn fixed -bg darkred -fg white -cr black -T white-on-red -geometry 110x40+100+100 &
xterm -sb -sl 1000 -fn fixed -bg darkgreen -fg white -cr red -T white-on-green -geometry 110x40+150+150 &
exec quartz-wm

This is a kernel bug, not am X11 bug.
