Impossible to log in via XDM
============================


XDM can be configured and run on OS X, but it is impossible to log in via it, either locally or remotely. The XDM login widget appears on local and remote displays, but any valid username and password simply returns a "Login incorrect" message. Using XDM is debug mode returns no useful information to diagnose problem. Documentation does not suggest any special requirements for logging in via XDM on OS X.

Not really an XQuartz issue. You should ask for help on the xorg mailing list.
