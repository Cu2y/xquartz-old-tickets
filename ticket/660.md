No more "Tray" window?
======================


(For programs running in Wine)

Previously, everything worked like it always had. Windows programs that had an icon in the Tray would have an icon in a wine window. Updated to 2.7.4, now that Tray window never appears. When I accidentally click 'Minimize to Tray', the program disappears completely. It can't be recovered, but continues to run in the background.

This is immediately after changing to 2.7.4, under OSX 10.6.8. I've already tried restarting, but it did not reset to the old behavior.

And 2.7.3 worked?

Can you please try the 2.7.4 betas?
