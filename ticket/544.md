Crash of 2.7.1\_rc3
===================


I've just allowed the automatic update to 2.7.1\_rc3 to install itself.

Unfortunately, X11 crashes now when loaded. It crashes at soon as my default xterm window comes up.

I am also experiencing this crash after auto-updating.

More details .....

As posted by Gabriel Phoenix, launchd respawns it. I've disabled "Open at Login" though.

Must closed my user session to stop this cycle.

Tried too to delete /tmp/.X11-unix

No success.

I hope this time I can revert to rc2 ... I was the unlucky one who reported bug [\#⁠532](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/532) (can't revert to previous build).

Hope you can fix this soon.
Regards,
Thierry

Hi,

I am having a similar problem. I was just asked to install rc3, and did. While installed, toward the end, it took a while to get through an item like "running package scripts." Anyway it ran. I start Xquartz, I get an xterm, which has its title bar too high (underneath the mac menu bar). I can even type in it, do ls and cd, and even use the X11 mac menu, but after several seconds X quits. I rebooted, and get the same thing.

So this is somewhat reproducible.

By the way, I use X almost every day, and the folks who write it deserve a lot of kudos! My colleagues w/ windows are always having way fun issues w/ their various X servers...

Strozzi2, that's exactly how it happened for me too.

According to the crashlog, apparently it has something to do with quartz-wm? Possibly because of what was changed for bug [\#⁠538](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/538)?

Here's something weird though: I just tried to downgrade to rc2 (which was working fine). Downloaded rc2, installed, OK. Launched, and everything is working BUT! in About it says I'm still running rc3. But it's working...

Then, the bug [\#⁠538](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/538) I've reported with rc1 is still unsolved. At least, it looks like X11.bin is not causing the crash of rc3 ... because even when reverting to rc2, X11.bin of rc3 is not replaced by the one of rc2.

I'll be waiting for the end of the week-end to see if there is a way to manually fix rc3 before to (try) reverting to rc2.

Thanks,
Thierry

Fixed in rc4. Sorry about that.

This is actually unrelated to [\#⁠538](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/538).

Confirmed: It's fixed for me.
Thanks you. I'll be able to get back to work on Monday.

Thanks a lot too for the good work on X11.

Btw, the link on page <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.7.1> to the 2.7.1 version is broken.
It would be good to include a link to <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/> for people who fell victim of this bug (like me).
Now, fingers crossed while installing rc4:) I would need to run X11 tomorrow in my class:)
