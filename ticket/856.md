XGetImage() always returns NULL with OSX 10.9 + XQuartz +Tk +TkImg
==================================================================


I've an application primarily using Tcl/Tk to provide a GUI on both OS-X and Linux. One of its requirements is to take a 'snapshot' of a specific Tk canvas so that it can be manipulated at the pixel level. A small sample of its code and actions, that demonstrate the problem, may be found from <https://www.dropbox.com/s/86pp744die1prf6/img-broken.tcl>

Under OSX-10.8.5 all was going well; upgrade to 10.9.1 and the application and sample script fail with the error message:

      Error in startup script: Window ".f0.map" cannot be transformed into a pixmap (possibly obscured?)
      while executing
      "image create photo snap -format window -data $map" (file "./broken.tcl" line 35)

The error message comes from TkImg's window/window.c:285 after a call to XGetImage() fails, by always returning NULL.
I appreciate that this sounds like an error in TkImg, but by changing combinations of the packages I'm using, and by producing the "smallest possible" Tk script and C code that fails, it appears that the problem is in the interface between TkImg and XgetImage(), with only the change from OSX 10.8 to OSX 10.9.

This combination of libraries/packages works for me:

    OSX 10.8.5, Xcode 5.0.2, XQuartz 2.7.4
    Tk 8.5, /System/Library/Tcl/8.5/Img1.4/

This combination does not:

    OSX 10.9.1, Xcode 5.0.2, XQuartz 2.7.5 (or 2.7.4)
    Tk 8.5 (or ActiveTcl 8.6), /System/Library/Tcl/8.5/Img1.4 (or Img1.4.2)

Any help most welcome, as I've found the error (message) but unsure which component is no longer working! Thank you.
