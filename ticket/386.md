Color Picker in GTK Color Selector Window Only Selects Black (XGetImage fails)
==============================================================================


The eyedropper color picker tool in the GTK color selector window reverts to black with any color selected. Colors can be selected fine manually, but with the eyedropper it always reverts to black. This affects all apps that use the GTK color selector window in X11.app.

Does this happen with version 2.3.5? (X11.app rather than XQuartz.app)

Is that the default version that comes with snow leopard? If it is then yes, this issue happens with that version as well. I've noticed this problem in Gimp and another app called mypaint, so I assume this issue affects all GTK apps that make use of the color selector window.

-   **Version** changed from *2.5.0 (xserver-1.7)* to *2.3.5 (xserver-1.4)*
-   **Milestone** set to *later*

Yes, 2.3.5 is the version with 10.6 through 10.6.2. 2.3.6 was the version updated in 10.6.3

I'll try to reproduce this later.

Do you know about older versions? How are they getting the color? XGetImage?

No not really, unfortunately. All I know is that this issue has existed at least from OSX 10.6.0 on. I don't know if it existed in older versions, I don't recall if I ever tried.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
