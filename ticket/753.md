failure to mount the disk(?)or something to that effect
=======================================================


I was told in a download X11 prompt that I did not have X11 installed, so I clicked continue and saved the X11 file to my Applications folder. I double clicked it and, well, "Failure To Launch"...i'm not sure how to specify the requested information below, but my iMac runs OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.3, and the Big Fish game i'm trying to play is called "Chains".
