This is not a bug in XQuartz. You're probably just not building php properly. I suggest you use your own freetype for your php rather than the one from XQuartz. If you want to use it though, it should work fine. You're probably just missing the -L option to php (or not providing PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH or similar) ... we don't ship the static libs (intentionally).
