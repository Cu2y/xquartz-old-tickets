X11.app becomes unresponsive until confusion-causing client is quit
===================================================================


i'm using the X11.app that comes with 10.6.1: XQuartz 2.3.4 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple45). this version apparently needs to be added to trac's version list.

i was using Visual Slick Edit today and did something i do very often: hit my keyboard shortcut to open the buffer list. this opens a new X window. when i did this, i got a beachball that never went away. Activity Monitor claimed X11 was unresponsive while the vs process was not. using Activity Monitor to gracefully quit vs brought X11.app back to life. i could then restart vs and things worked as normal. i guess this means i lost a race rather than got X11.app into a weird state.

attached are sequential samples of X11.app and vs.

hrm. X11 became unresponsive again a few minutes later while i was just typing in vs, so maybe it really was in a bad state. in any case, i restarted it.

The samples look good to me. Can you tell me how to reproduce the problem.

2.3.4 isn't a release from the XQuartz project. It's an Apple release, and it's mentioned on the [Releases](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases) page.

hi, jeremy.

unfortunately, i have no idea how to repro the problem. today is the first time this has happened to me. after restarting X11, it happened again. i realize i wasn't "just typing". i had hit &lt;cmd&gt;-t in vs, a shortcut i have mapped. this is the same thing i did to trigger it the third time after the restart. so all three times were after hitting a &lt;cmd&gt; key combo.

on the third time, i went away from my computer for a bit. when i came back, the buffer in vs had zillions of t's and T's, alternating in bunches, and they were still being generated. i hit another key on the keyboard and they stopped. so my new guess is that the bug, wherever it lies, manifests itself as a key being repeatedly. strange thing is this had never happened before and i've been on 10.6.1 using vs constantly for a while, now.

This has been fixed internally and should be working with 2.5.0-beta2 (to be released sometime this month)
