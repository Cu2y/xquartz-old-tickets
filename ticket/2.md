Spaces does not work with X11
=============================


This is the most likely cause of the expose / spaces / focus bugs
See <http://lists.apple.com/archives/X11-users/2007/Nov/msg00312.html>

Just to be clear -- between when I wrote that email and now, I believe we've fixed all of the Quartz window event bugs I mentioned, \*except\* the one where you can re-order windows in Expose mode. I'm still trying to find out what event we should be receiving that lets us know that we need to change the stacking; I'll talk to the libXplugin team.

It also seems like there is a strict ordering between all X11 windows, even when they are in different **Spaces**, this makes **Spaces** switch desktop when clicking in a window that is obscured by a window in another desktop. This can easily be seen by having two xterms slightly offseted on different desktops, and observe the focus behaviour.

I'm told that if a window is clicked in Expose mode to bring it to the front, we'll receive an XP\_WINDOW\_STATE event.

/\* Possible window states. \*/

enum xp\_window\_state\_enum {

> /\* The window is not in the global list of possibly-visible windows. \*/
> XP\_WINDOW\_STATE\_OFFSCREEN = 1 &lt;&lt; 0,

> /\* Parts of the window may be obscured by other windows. \*/
> XP\_WINDOW\_STATE\_OBSCURED = 1 &lt;&lt; 1,

};

Presumably, we'll receive a state of zero (not offscreen, not obscured). Would always raising that window to the top of the stack result in correct behavior, or are there other cases this doesn't fit?

AFAICT that should take care of clicking behaviour, but the weird focus behavior (windows in other spaces affects focus and cursor) is not affected (I think).

Well, if we should be getting XP\_EVENT\_WINDOW\_STATE\_CHANGED on expose window changes, we're not. I just verified it with DEBUG\_LOG, and the only time I'm ever seeing XP\_EVENT\_WINDOW\_STATE\_CHANGED is on show/hide (including spaces "F8")... plus it seems like that is how it should be, right?

If X11 is the foreground applicaiton, Expose works for selection the first window made by X11. If you select any other X11 window, hit F9, then choose the first X11 window, focus switches correctly. Doing this shows the following in the debug log:

quartz.c:QuartzProcessEvent:501 kXDarwinBringAllToFront
darwinEvents.c:ProcessInputEvents:535 kxDarwinUpdateModifiers(0, 0, (empty))

when you try focusing on another window via expose, focus remains on the current window, and you just see:
darwinEvents.c:ProcessInputEvents:535 kxDarwinUpdateModifiers(0, 0, (empty))

FTR, I'm almost positive that the kXDarwinBringAllToFront is a biproduct of it working, not the cause of it working.

Additionally, QuartzProcessEvent isn't getting the kXDarwinActivate event when switching in from another application via expose like it is when switching normally.

-   **Summary** changed from *X11 window events don't sync with Quartz* to *Spaces does not work with X11*

The exposé issue is fixed in 2.2.0.
Renaming this bug to just focus on the spaces issue.
