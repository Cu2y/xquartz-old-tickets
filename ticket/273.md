Incorrect version recorded in Finder
====================================


The Finder's "Get Info" window displays "X11 Version 2.0, Copyright 2007 Apple Inc.", despite the version being correctly reported (as 2.3.3.2) in X11's "About X11" window.

This was previously reported in [this closed ticket](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/189), but a little unclearly.

If anything, this is a bug in Finder not invalidating its cache.

So are you saying that there is a cache file that I can trash that would resolve this problem?

No, I have no idea how Finder works internally. I've just seen that sometimes the detail in the Finder window is not consistent. Check the actual Info.plist.
