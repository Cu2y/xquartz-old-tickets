root resolution confusing to apps?
==================================


I may be missing something basic, but I've used xv with XQuartz for years and found that if I "M" (maxpect") an image, the bottom of the image falls below the bottom of the screen. I've always thought it was because of the title bar you put on all windows since thats exactly how far it falls off the bottom (~45-50 pixels).

xwinfo -root shows
Width: 1680
Height: 1050

and xv seems to use that faithfully, but with the Apple menu bar taking up a chunk of that, x11 doesn't really have all of the 1050 height.

Is there a simple way to fix this, or work around it? I've tried various things with no luck.

Please note I've listed this priority as minor, but I have been noticing this behavious for several years.

thanks for any help.

Please ask on the mailing list. Bug reports are not a forum.

The Apple menu bar is not part of the X11 screen. (0,0) in X11 coordinates is just below the lower left corner of the OSX menu bar.

For example, I have a 1920x1200 display, but xwinfo -root shows:

Height: 1178

because the menu bar has a height of 22 pixels.
