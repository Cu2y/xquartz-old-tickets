x11 can not be found
====================


Was using a favorite program with snow leopard: Bible Explorer 4. Upgraded OS to Mountain Lion and installed XQuartz. The error message above is displayed when trying to open program. Have logged off and on. Can you help?
Bible Explorer 4 version 4.1.2.12.01

That's not a bug in XQuartz. That application has been broken for over 5 years. Please report the issue to them.
