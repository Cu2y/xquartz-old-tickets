Xephyr broken on Mavericks.
===========================


Simply running:

    Xephyr :1

from within a X session yields:

    Fatal server error:
    failed to create root window

The same used to work on the previous release.

How can I get clues on what's happening?

I'd suggest asking on xorg-devel for help.

I can reproduce this... hopefully this can get fixed for 2.7.6 ...

Can you please provide an ETA when this would be resolved ? We rely on Xephyr to run Selenium tests in headless mode and this is a big blocker. Very much appreciate your feedback. Thanks

There is no ETA. If this is a big blocker for you, please devote some resources to addressing the issue. Have you tried different versions of xorg-server to see when it was introduced?

I just rolled back to XQuartz 2.7.4 (I am using Mavericks on very recent MBP) and I am able to run Xephyr :1 without the exception reported here. However I am still not able to run my Selenium tests in headless mode but that maybe some setup issue on my side. I'll report back if I find anything related to Xephyr.
Thanks

2.7.4 and 2.7.6 have the exact same versions of Xephyr (1.6.5-apple3)

It is something about the Xephyr build itself. The sources are the same, but using Xephyr from 2.7.4 on top of 2.7.7 works.

Xephyr binary from 2.7.4 for convenience (bzip2 compressed)

Rebuilding 2.7.4 with 2.7.6 installed produces a bad Xephyr as well.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Fixed*

Building Xephyr from 1.15.1 seems to not have this issue (although it still has the keymap issue). I'll just package up the old built binary as I don't think it's worth investigating further.

This will be addressed in 2.7.7\_beta2
