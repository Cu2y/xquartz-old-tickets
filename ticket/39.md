I forget to say that I am running wine 0.9.51 on Mac os x Leopard 10.5.1

Why do you need DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/X11/lib? Where are you getting wine from? macports? fink? compiled yourself? what is the output of 'otool -L &lt;path to wine&gt;'?

Honestly, getting wine working is a low priority at this point because of other issues still around, but it is something that should work.

I need to do DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/X11/lib because if i don't do anything i get

err:wgl:X11DRV\_ChoosePixelFormat No libGL on this box - disabling OpenGL support !
err:d3d:WineD3D\_CreateFakeGLContext Can't find a suitable iPixelFormat
err:d3d:InitAdapters Failed to get a gl context for default adapter

I compiled wine by myself.
The output of 'otool -L /usr/local/bine/wine' is
wine:

> @executable\_path/../lib/libwine.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
> /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.0.0)
> /usr/lib/libgcc\_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)

I'm new on mac os x but i have some experience compiling programms on linux.

Thanks for trying to help me.

Ok, I'm guessing wine tries to dlopen libGL from the wrong location there...

As for wine... like I said... this is something that is pretty far off, so I'll leave the bug open, but I doubt we'll be able to tackle it for a few months atleast. You might have better support from a wine mailing list
