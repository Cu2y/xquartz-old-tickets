default X11 tunneling breaks my apps
====================================


It seems that the default for the server is to use ssh tunneling. I have apps that
need to use DISPLAY as &lt;hostname&gt;:0.0 which no longer works in XQuartz 2.1.5 and 2.3.1. Is there a way to change the default so the above syntax will work again?

What do you mean "the default for the server is to use ssh tunneling" Please elaborate.

1) What "server" are you talking about? X11 doesn't care about ssh.
2) Apps don't NEED to use DISPLAY as &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;display num&gt;. They need DISPLAY to be a valid text field that can be used by XOpenDisplay to connect to a valid server. Note that &lt;display num&gt; is not always 0 too.
3) You can use tcp for X11 if you really want to instead of ssh tunneling, but you need to enable that option in the security settings in the X11 preferences. In other words, if you want to open yourself up to a security problem, you need to specifically enable that security hole.
