Malfunctioning traffic lights on external monitor
=================================================


On 2.3.2\_rc2 I'm ssh'ing into my linux workstation and displaying all of its windows
back on my laptop. If I spawn an X11 window that appears on my laptop screen and
then drag it across to the external monitor, I can still resize the window via
the handle on the bottom right as usual, but if I click on the green dot in the
top left to maximize the window, the traffic lights light up with x-+ but no
window resizing happens when I click the green dot. In fact, the x-+ remain
displayed within the traffic lights even after moving the mouse away. A click in
the body of the window is required to reset things. The window can only be
resized via the handle on the bottom right.
