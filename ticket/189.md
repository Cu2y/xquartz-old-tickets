Incorrect version recorded in package?
======================================


Hi,

I have installed version 2.3.1 on three computers, and when I seek the information on the x11 package one each machine, I get version 2.0.

Is this a bug? It would be nice to have the package report a version number that lets me know if it's time to upgrade or not.

Thanks.

Payam

2.3.1 reports 2.3.1. So... yeah, your system is messed up. Are you sure you're starting the correct X11? It might be the case that you moved X11.app somewhere else on your system... Join the x11-users mailing list and ask for help there. Report the output of 'ps ax | grep X' while X11.app is running.
