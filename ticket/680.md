Mouse escapes from screen with wine
===================================


Hi all,
When I try to run Dishonored with wine and force it to use the latest xquartz, it says that x11 is asking to change the resolution, and when I allow it fullscreens a black box that doesn't change (but the audio from the game runs). I figured out that by releasing the fullscreen with command-option-a starts the video too, but the mouse escapes from the program when I move it too far in any direction, which makes the game annoying to the point of being unplayable. So I'm looking for a way to either make the video work in the fullscreen or to lock the mouse into the game window. I'm not entirely sure if this is an xquartz error or a wine error because I can't get wine's x11 to even load the window.

Thanks very much!

OS X 10.8 (12A269)

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Component** changed from *quartz-wm* to *xserver*
-   **Resolution** set to *insufficient information*

Please verify that this application runs as expected on Linux or FreeBSD first. There are too many variables on the XQuartz path for one to know that it's an XQuartz issue.
