X11 windows disappear when moving to second monitor
===================================================


Using OS X 10.9 Maverick + XQuartz 2.7.5 (xorg-server 1.14.4)

When an X windows appears on one monitor and I want to drag it to the next monitor, it doesn't draw on the second monitor. Please see attached screenshot for example with clock.

Using Mission control I can move the X window from one display to another and it draws properly but just dragging by the title bar has this problem.

This didn't used to be a problem with OS X 10.8 and XQuartz 2.7.4

Thanks, Bob
