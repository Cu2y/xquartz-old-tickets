X11 Window title bar in the background displays pre-leopard stripes
===================================================================


The look of window title bar has changed in Leopard: a window which is visible but not front-most has a title bar of solid light grey. X11.app draws its windows with the old fashioned light grey stripes.

-   **Component** changed from *x11-apps* to *X11.pkg*

Unfortunately, this is a problem with quartz-wm which is not managed by this project. I'm going to leave this ticket open, however, in hopes that we will eventually get access to that.

Please file a bug for this at bugreporter.apple.com as well.

I have filed a bug to Apple: Bug ID\# 5642856. Since it has likely already been reported to them, they will come back to me with the original bug number. I will update the history with it when I get it.
