-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.2*

It's crashing in doOpenFont ... looks like a memory management issue because it's aborting in free() ... I don't see anything here related to waking your laptop.

Can you reproduce in 2.6.1\_rc1? Can you reproduce it on-demand?

Mike, can you please test with 2.6.2\_beta1? Are you able to reproduce it on demand? Do you know which font was causing the problem?
