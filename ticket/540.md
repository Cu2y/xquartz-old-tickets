Xinput2 is missing
==================


Wine likes to have Xinput2, and possibly other applications as well. XQuartz doesn't seem to have it, so it would be nice if that could somehow be added..

See, among others: <http://www.x.org/wiki/XI2>, <http://www.clearchain.com/blog/posts/xinput-1-xinput-2-conversion-guide> for what is expected of it, and <http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1599025.html>

But I am sure you know better than those few posts what is needed.

-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

We've supported Xi2 since I believe XQuartz 2.5.0 (ie: when it was added to xorg-server). You can verify the version of xinput on the server by running 'xinput --version'
