GLX: Surface ID invalid after FUS
=================================


Hi,

I'm using MacOS 10.5.7 and XQuartz 2.3.3.2 on an "early 2009" nVidia Mac mini.

When X11 is running, with no client, switching to another desktop user (without logging out) and back again causes the desktop background to become completely white, except from the icons. No background picture is shown anymore.
Terminating X11 resumes normal behaviour (resuming functional icons and the background picture that I've set to change every few minutes).

On the white background, the desktop icons on the right hand side are drawn, but dead: just as if they were pictures only. The top menu line is drawn, but functional. Beside that, the screen is completely white - like erased by xsetbg.

Alt-TAB shows the running applications, permits to switch to X11.app and quit it.

Switching users is not enough to produce this bug. Wine must have been started and terminated (by the first user). Obviously Wine is doing something on behalf of one or another applications that persists even after Wine and any other X clients terminate, and is noticeable only by switching users.

I still need to investigate which .exe produce this effect. Simply running "wine winecfg" or regedit.exe is not enough.

winecfg is set to 800x600 virtual desktop mode (full screen does not seem to work?). I've compiled Wine-1.1.23 myself using nothing but the packages found on Apple's install DVD and XQuartz: no Fink, no MacPorts.

Regards,

> Jörg Höhle

What do you mean by background? Do you mean the X root window? Are you in fullscreen mode in X11 or rootless mode?

I can confirm that this bug is still present in version 2.5.0. In order to reproduce it you have to run a DX game (for me worked only with DX9 games) in full screen mode. For instance this one: <http://www.gamershell.com/download_14534.shtml>. If I run it in windowed mode and change it to full screen everything works fine but if I try to run full screen mode directly I get bunch of these:

I think this problem is similar (or even the same) to [\#⁠420](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/420). Did you test this game? At the start (in "fullscreen mode") it first displays small windows (for a second or shorter) and after that the windows is "changed" to fullscreen mode so it may work the same. But as I have said before If I run the game in windowed mode. It does something like this: displays small window for short period of time. Dispisplays "normal" game window. And after manually switching to full screen mode it works nicely. Maybe it's some kind of race condition?

Yes, that is what I meant by my statement above. The underlying similarity is that the GLX clients have a stale CoreGraphics context.

I've noticed you changed milestone to "later". Does it mean can't expect anything (even "quick fix") soon?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
