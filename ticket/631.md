Rename XQuartz into X11 for Mountain Lion
=========================================


Since Mountain Lion apparently no longer ships X11.app and sents people to XQuartz, you should rename XQuartz.app into X11.app, maybe with just creating a symlink or Finder Alias.

Reason: Some programs actually check for the presence of X11.app instead of just trying to connect to the X11 server. These programs fail as there is no longer an X11.app on 10.8. I just had this problem yesterday with a user trying to run IDL (www.exelisvis.com/idl/).

I am also going to file a bug with the IDL people.

Ahem, I just noticed that you actually already did this when restarting my own XQuartz installation showed me the 2.7.3 update and the update wrote itself into X11.app. Thanks a lot :)

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *wontfix*

The installer will update the app wherever it is moved to or renamed. I'm guessing you renamed XQuartz.app to X11.app which is why the installer updated X11.app.

We've been using XQuartz.app for years now, and I don't want to change it just because some 3rd party applications do something weird if X11.app doesn't exist.
