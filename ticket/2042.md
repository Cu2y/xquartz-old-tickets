xterm fails to recognize group everyone membership
==================================================


For network accounts, xterm does not recognize the user as a member of group "everyone". This is not an issue for local accounts.

When a network account user (Active Directory) checks group membership with the commands "groups", "id", etc. the output indicates that the user is a member of the group "everyone". If the user tries to chgrp a file that they own to "everyone", the chgrp fails with "chgrp: you are not a member of group everyone". Running the same chgrp command in a Terminal window succeeds.

This problem has been confirmed with XQuartz 2.7.4 on Mac OS X 10.9.4 and with XQuartz 2.7.7 on Mac OS X 10.9.5.

I can't see how this could have anything to do with xterm. All xterm is doing here is providing you a terminal in which to run your shell which execs your commands.
