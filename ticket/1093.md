xQuartz doesn't work (no title bar & crashes after few minutes)
===============================================================


Hi everyone !

My installation of xQuartz has never worked on my computer (Mac OS 10.6.8). The problems are :

-   Crashes after few minutes of use ...
-   All softwares using xQuartz don't have title bar (xterm - simulink - etc...)

It's very annoying... I need to use some softwares (R & Simulink) and it's impossible to work, after 3 min all softwares stop working.

So I uninstalled several times xQuartz from the directory /users/Applications/Utilites and all files concerning xQuartez in the repertory /users/Library/LauchAgents & LauchDeamons

Does anyone have a solution please ?

Thx !!

This is not a support forum. This is a bug reporting system. There is nothing actionable in your report: you mentioned crashes, but you did not attach crash logs.

Seeing as how this has been working for people for years on Snow Leopard, it's more likely a local configuration issue. Please join the x11-users mailing list and ask for help there (make sure you include the crash log). Also, try creating a new user account and test with that account.
