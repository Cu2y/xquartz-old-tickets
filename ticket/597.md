Xquartz 2.7.2 failed to launch as root
======================================


Xquartz 2.7.2 fails to launch as root on 10.8.6 Snow Leopard. It starts, then dies, then starts again in an infinite loop until restart. Permissions were repaired twice. The log has numerous entries such as:

In spite of this, XQuartz works as standard user and as Admin user, but root user is required to install IDL

Good. You shouldn't be running it as root anyway.

You don't need a root-owned X11 server to install IDL. You just need root permissions to install IDL. There is no requirement on the X11 server running as root to do that.
