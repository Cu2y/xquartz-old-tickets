Unable to access the X Display 20 minutes after X11 terminal is started
=======================================================================


About 20 minutes after logging into a Linux server using Terminal/XQuartz, the server is no longer able to open a new X-window on the Mac. This problem occurs with multiple applications, including Python 2.6 and 2.7, and IDL 8.0. The problem does not occur on OSX 10.6.x systems with the Apple installed X11 software.

Example: a python script which opens a X-window to display a simple chart is executed every five minutes on a Linux server. The first four times, the script is able to open a new X-window and display the chart. The fifth time, i.e. about 20 minutes after logging in the Linux server from an iMac, the script can no longer open an X-window on the iMac and displays the error "Unable to access the X Display, is $DISPLAY set properly?" Following is how the terminal looks like (with some edits to improve readability).

imac:~ pete$ ssh pete@linux-svr

\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ more test.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(\[1,2,3,4,5\])
plt.show()

\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ python test.py
\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ python test.py
\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ python test.py
\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ python test.py
\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$ python test.py
Unable to access the X Display, is $DISPLAY set properly?
\[pete@linux-svr ~\]$

So far, I aware of two workarounds, none of them is ideal:

Workaround [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1): Log out and log back in. By logging out and then logging back in, without restarting the Terminal session, the Linux server can again --for another 20 minutes-- open new X-windows.

Workaround [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2): downgrade back to OSX 10.6.x with Apple installed X11 software.

A fix to XQuartz or a better workaround would be greatly appreciated, e.g. something that extends the 20 minutes.

Let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you,
Pieter V.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *behaves correctly*

That's how ForwardX11Timeout was designed to work. Read the ssh\_config man page.

In case it's not clear, this has nothing to do with X11. ssh is the one closing the tunnel.
