Xquartz has anchored windows after Macports xorg-server installation
====================================================================


Hi guys,
I installed xorg-server from Macports after deleting Xquartz. After that I removed xorg-server by Macports and reinstalled Xquartz, but now Xquartz has anchored windows, without moving and resize possibility, and the arrow mouse icon is the classical X.
So something has screwed up the configuration. How can I restore the original behavior of Xquartz ?
I'm under Mountain Lion, installed from a formatted HD. I have tried both 2.7.4 and the latest dev one.

Thank you,
Fra

sudo port -v -f uninstall xorg-server

Then just install the pkg from XQuartz.

I don't really understand the problem. Is quartz-wm running?

Thank you Jeremy!
I think so, but actually I don't know for sure.
The problem is that the windows created in X11 are not movable and resizable as before than xorg-server installation using MacPorts.

It's really strange...

The situation has been reverted after the x11-dev package installation from Fink.
