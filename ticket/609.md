XQuarts doesn't start on case sensitive fs
==========================================


XQuartz will not start when installed onto a case sensitive file system.

2.6.3 started fine.

This is a fresh install of OSX, Previously the disk was case insensitive.

Can you please give more information. What happens when you try to launch it? Can you provide /var/log/system.log and ~/Library/Logs/X11/\*.log? How are you trying to launch it?

It was a fresh OS install but my home folder had permission problems which caused issued.
Its all fixed now - there wasn't a problem. Please close this bug.
