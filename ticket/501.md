BadMatch error when calling XGetImage
=====================================


XQuartz crashes when I attempt to use XGetImage repeatedly in the most recent version of XPPAUT

    X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
      Major opcode of failed request:  73 (X_GetImage)
      Serial number of failed request:  9059
      Current serial number in output stream:  9059

This error does not occur on Windows using XMing or on an older Mac using X11 2.1.6.
It seems to be the most recent versions

Can one get older versions of the X Server?

The bug occurs on snow leopard and on lion

Thanks

Bard Ermentrout

yes, old versions are available. Go download one from the releases page if you want it.

You said this caused a crash, but I don't see a crash report. Please attach the crash report and a reduced set of instructions for how to reproduce the crash.

Also, try running under GuardMalloc.
