MATLAB Focus Bug when Application Switching
===========================================


MATLAB fails to focus properly when switching apps with Apple+Tab.

The window comes into view, however is not focused; and a mouse click is needed to make it accept user input.

MATLAB uses the X11 server, and Java, so there might be a bug in Java as well. This bug has been reported to Mathworks too, but it seems the problem stems from the Apple side as they suggest on the bug report 418140

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.3.3 (xserver-1.4)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.0*

Can you provide a link to this bug report 418140?

When you cmd+tab to X11, what application is in focus? It should always be the previously focused X11 application. I can't reproduce this with other X11 apps.

Are you using 2.3.3?

dupe [\#⁠192](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/192). This is most likely due to the checkbox at the bottom of the Spaces preference pane being disabled.

Hi, the bug report on Mathworks is here: <http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/418140>

This is not related due to Spaces, I tried disabling it and the problem persists.

The focused apps is MATLAB, but the window is not focused. It comes to foreground, but doesn't get keyboard input.

Most possibly this is not an X11 bug, but anyway I'm just reposting to say that it is not a duplicate of [\#⁠192](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/192).

Another info:

If Witch is installed, switching to a MATLAB windows "twice" actually focuses that window.

what is the state of the "when switching to an application, switch to a space with that app" checkbox in spaces preferences?

It is checked. It brings up the window fine most of the time, but the window is not selected.

If it is not checked, the menu bar still shows MATLAB as the selected app, but it doesn't bring up the window.

Another MATLAB related bug I have is when I run the MATLAB app, it tries to start, it starts up X11, then dies. When I kill X11, it immediately spawns another X11, and it starts correctly. I think I need another bug report for that.

Running it using the MATLAB script in Terminal starts it fine though.

What is the system.log output for your respawning X11? I'd recommend asking on x11-users rather than filing a bug because it's most likely not a bug but a configuration problem.

Also, if the menubar shows MATLAB as the selected app, then the window you are selecting is a MATLAB window, not an X11 window. So this is definitely a MATLAB bug and not an X11 bug.

OK, I agree that this clearly is a MATLAB bug.

I posted the other problem on the users list here : <http://lists.apple.com/archives/X11-users/2009/Jun/msg00090.html>
