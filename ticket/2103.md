When trying to launch Open NX and X11 error message appears
===========================================================


Uninstallation and reinstallation of both programs does not correct the issue.
This is the message:

An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot move old log file "/Users/laubinge/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log" to "/Users/laubinge/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log.old"
"

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

Can you investigate \*why\* you're unable to do that?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Likely user error due to permissions. Closing due to lack of response.
