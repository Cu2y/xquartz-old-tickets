full-screen X11 starts rootless at first
========================================


I'm using X11 2.3.2\_rc4 configured for "full screen" output.

My .xinitrc currently says:

> exec icewm

When X11 is started as a side effect of starting an X11 app from
the apple desktop the app shows up in "rootless" mode i.e. as a
standalone window on the apple desktop. It is properly reparented
by the icewm window manager and thus has a title bar supplied by
icewm. As soon as X11 gets the focus, either by command-tab or by
clicking on the new app X11 leaps happily into full screen mode and
seems happy thereafter.

I would remark that it seems more tied to X11 getting the apple
desktop focus than the "first app", because my earlier experiments
using fvwm would show the new app and also some windows that FVWM
would create during its startup.

Procedure:

-   in preferences, choose full screen mode
-   quit X11
-   start an X11 app, it should appear on the apple desktop
-   command-tab to X11, full screen mode should activate

This should be working fine in 2.3.2\_rc5 now

I don't see this happening in 2.4.0\_beta1 (which will be shipping shortly)
