X11 not found by GIMP
=====================


After installing XQuartz 2.7.4 and starting Gimp, a dialogue box is opened by Gimp asking for the location of X11

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

Did you logout and log back in as instructed by the installer?

If the issue persists after relogging, go file a bug with gimp.

Installed new version of Gimp (2.8) and problem disappeared. Ticket may be closed

According to <http://www.gimp.org/downloads/>

> GIMP for Mac OS X

> Since the 2.8.2 version GIMP runs on OSX natively. No X11 environment is required.

I installed 2.8.2 GIMP from this page also, and it launches fine, fyi. (on Mountain Lion 10.8.3).
