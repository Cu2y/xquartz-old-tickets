Hang in X11
===========


I am not sure what caused this, but I thought I would report this hang in the 2.5.1\_rc1 release. I took a sample, which is attached. I force quit, which caused the Apple crash reportere to come up, and I am including what was there as well.

It looks like a crash in here, and FatalError didn't handle it gracefully:

    24                                           562 -[X11Application handleMachMessage:]
    25                                              562 -[X11Controller set_window_menu_check:]
    26                                                562 -[NSMenu itemChanged:]

BTW, your crash report is badly formatted. Can you please attach the actual report (likely in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports)

This code has been unchanged for a long time. I'd be surprised if this is a new issue. Have you seen a crash like this before? Do you have any way to reproduce it?
