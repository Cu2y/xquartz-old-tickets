GIMP windows not taking focus, freezing X11/XQuartz
===================================================


I updated my X11 and XQuartz the other day to RC3 on Snow Leopard 10.6.1. I tried to launch GIMP 2.6.7, which I downloaded from gimp.lisanet.de. Every time I click anywhere in any window except for on the title bar, the window fails to properly take focus. It comes to the front, but I cannot click anything on it. Clicking other windows does not work. The X11 terminal doesn't accept keyboard input either. When I mouseover the zoom, minimize and close buttons on each window, they light up like I could click them, but when I do nothing happens. I have to quit X11 without saving anything in GIMP and start over. This happens every single time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled both GIMP and X11/XQuartz (from both the OS X install DVD and from the RC3 installer package). It still does not work properly. Nothing in X11 functions if I just click anywhere except the title bar of an inactive window.
