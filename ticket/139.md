Wacom-Tablet doesn't work anymore with 2.3
==========================================


I installed 2.3 yesterday and now my Wacom Bamboo isn't working anymore. When i move the pen over the pad the cursor also moves, but when i try to click on somthing in a X11-app it doesn't work. So in gimp i simply can't use the tablet anymore.

Please run 'xinput list' You should see the Quartz Tablet device listed. Then run 'xinput list \#' where \# is the \# corresponding to the tablet (I believe it's 3, but I don't have a usable X11 at the moment due to rebuilding, so I can't check at the moment.

You should see input events spewing on your screen from the tablet.

If it's spewing out the right info for xinput test and not working in gimp, it's because gtk for some reason doesn't want to work with the data we're sending them. This is a known issue, but nobody on the gtk side wants to answer our emails about this, so go complain to them.

I guess you meant running 'xinput test \#' (where \# is indeed 3) rather than 'xinput list \#'. I did that the the result is:

-   no event registered when the pen moves

<!-- -->

-   *motion* events registered on pen click or mouse left click (even when the mouse does not move at all)

For example this is one mouse click

    $ xinput test 3
    motion a[0]=1020 a[1]=606 a[2]=1000 a[3]=0 a[4]=0 
    motion a[0]=1020 a[1]=606 a[2]=1000 a[3]=0 a[4]=0 
    motion a[0]=1020 a[1]=606 a[2]=1000 a[3]=0 a[4]=0 
    motion a[0]=1020 a[1]=606 a[2]=1000 a[3]=0 a[4]=0 
    ^C

right click event are not registered there.

In xev however, motion events and all clicks are registered. But clicks are still registered as motion events and not button down and button release as they should. I guess that is why applications are not responsive to clicks.

Again this is one left click in xev

In addition, the mouse clicks are not registered in purely X programs so the problem is not (or at least not entirely) caused by GTK.

This is with a Wacom Intuos 3

Thanks in advance for your help.

Sorry I reopened this one. I did not see that the ticket [\#⁠142](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/142) was the one milestoned for 2.3.1. I thought this one was the oldest anyhow. I will link from there to here since there are more details in my comment above.
