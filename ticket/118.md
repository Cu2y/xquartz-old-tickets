first instance of xterm hangs and maxes out CPU
===============================================


Today I updated to Mac OS X 10.5.3 and subsequently updated to X11 2.2.1. I noticed that shortly after launching X11 my CPU fan whirred up, and realized that the xterm that usually launches when X11 starts up did not launch. I checked top and found that the xterm process was apparently hanging, maxing out my CPU usage.

Further investigating, I found that if I killed the hanging xterm, the next time I called xterm, that xterm process would also hang. However, if the hanging process was put in the background, I could successfully open new xterms (e.g. from Terminal, from already open xterms, or using Command-N).

The fact that the hanging xterm eats up CPU is a big problem for me. I wonder if this is related to the race condition identified in Ticket [\#⁠3](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/3)?
