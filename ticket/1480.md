cannot open XQuartz
===================


I downloaded your installer and when I click on it to open it I get the message: "Welcome to the XQuartz Installer". It wants me to reinstall the software. I have done this twice. I cannot get this to open so I can use it on my Clip Art. Please help.

Thank you,
Abbe

Yes, if you reopen the installer, it will reinstall. You need to open the installed application after you install it. /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app
