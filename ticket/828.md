Remote host not working
=======================


After updating to 2.7.5 my remote host can no longer access
the X11 server.

I have "Allow connections from network clients" enabled in the
Security dialog.

My remote host has the proper DISPLAY environment variable.

And - I have executed

> xhost +

which should allow it.

It's as if the security option is being ignored.

This worked fine moments before the upgrade...

Has something changed?

1) You should use ssh rather than 'xhost +'

2) What is the remote's DISPLAY envvar?

3) What is the output of "ps x | grep Xquartz"

Hello Jeremy,

> Thanks for your comment.

> Here is the output of ps -x | grep Xquartz

      bash-3.2$ ps -x | grep Xquartz
    21214 ??         0:00.01 /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/launchd_startx /opt/X11/bin/startx -- /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz
    21215 ??         0:00.04 /bin/sh /opt/X11/bin/startx -- /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz
    21265 ??         0:00.00 /opt/X11/bin/xinit /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz :3 -auth /Users/rivers/.serverauth.21215
    21266 ??         0:00.01 /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz :3 -auth /Users/rivers/.serverauth.21215
    21370 ttys002    0:00.00 grep Xquartz

Looking at the /bin/ps output, I see it started the server on :3 instead of :0... when I set the DISPLAY to "macmini:3" - it all worked.

So - it seems the X server is listing on a different port number than it did previously? Wonder why it switched from :0 to :3 ?

The remote host would need an ssh server, not the client. Why doesn't it have an ssh server? That is quite bizarre. How are you connecting to it?

> The DISPLAY environment variable on the remote host is set to macmini:0

Well based on the output of 'ps -x', the variable should've been set to macmini:3

> So - it seems the X server is listing on a different port number than it did previously? Wonder why it switched from :0 to :3 ?

You can't assume anything about what that will be set to by xinit. It likely was :3 because :0 was taken because of another bug where they're not getting cleaned up after XQuartz exits.

Hi Jeremy,

> Ah! if the port is taken then that's why it's getting :3 (although, if the server isn't running, how is the port busy? xinit is holding on to it?)

> Regarding your other question, we access this rather ancient BSD box via rlogin. It has no ssh on it.

> Do you happen to know the ticket number of the other bug where the port numbers aren't getting cleaned up? I'd like to add my e-mail to its CC list.

-   Thanks!
