Xquartz "quits unexpectedly", \*may\* be related to coming out of sleep
=======================================================================


Hi,

Several times recently, Xquarts 2.6.2 on SnowLeopard 10.6.7 will "quit unexpectedly". It's an Intel macbook or whatever they call their laptops. Apple then gives me this error report, which I send to them (I assume it's a black hole). I will attach the most recent one.

This \*may\* be related to coming out of sleep. It doesn't always happen when I wake up. But this time, and I think others, it occurs when I dock my laptop at work in the morning.

Anyway thought you should know.

It's not a black hole, but filing here gets my attention quicker.

Please use 2.6.3\_rc1. That fixed a couple memory smashers and some other crashes as well. There was one new regression in indirect GLX which has since been fixed.
