XQuartz launchd command; interference by .profile
=================================================


The launchd command is `/bin/bash --login /usr/X11/bin/startx`, but this allows settings in .profile to interfere with the launching of X11, which seems like an issue.

With MacPorts, it's not uncommon to set DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to /opt/local/lib; I was doing so, and then X11 wouldn't start:

    Mar  5 15:16:36 mandala org.x.X11[2306]: xauth:  creating new authority file /Users/steve/.serverauth.2306
    Mar  5 15:16:36 mandala org.x.X11[2306]: xinit: Detected Xquartz startup, setting file=X, argv[0]=/Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
    Mar  5 15:16:36 mandala org.x.X11[2306]: dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart
    Mar  5 15:16:36 mandala org.x.X11[2306]:   Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
    Mar  5 15:16:36 mandala org.x.X11[2306]:   Expected in: /opt/local/lib/libJPEG.dylib

The error was a bit obscure, and while I was able to figure it out, I'm wondering if it would be safer to either launch `startx` directly, or to blank out DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. I don't know enough to understand the rationale behind launching startx via bash, but it seems undesirable to let the user break a system agent like this. Also, would this even allow a root privilege escalation attack by putting commands in .profile?
