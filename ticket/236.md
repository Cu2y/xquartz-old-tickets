X11 crashes on startup with library incompatibility
===================================================


I recently upgraded OSX to 10.5.6, and installed the 2.3.2.1 package. Upon trying to start X11, I get immediate crash, with a libpixman library compatibility problem. CrashReporter crash log contains the following:

    Process:         X11.bin [643]
    Path:            /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
    Identifier:      org.x.X11
    Version:         ??? (???)
    Build Info:      X11server-480400~3
    Code Type:       X86 (Native)
    Parent Process:  launchd [89]

    OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.5.6 (9G55)
    Report Version:  6

    Exception Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)
    Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000
    Crashed Thread:  0

    Dyld Error Message:
      Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib
      Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacO/X11.bin
      Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 13.0.0 or later, but libpixman-1.0.dylib provides version 12.0.0

I routed around the problem for now by installed libpixman-0.13.2 from source...maybe this needs to be updated in Xquartz package? Or have I just done something stupid?

cheers

You need to reinstall the XQuartz package after you install an OS Update.

Package was installed AFTER all OSX system updates. 2.3.2.1 claims to require libpixman 13.0.0, but 2.3.2.1 provides libpixman 12.0.0. I believe the package is still in error.

/usr/X11/lib/libpixman-1.0.dylib is definitely 13.0.0 in 2.3.2.1

Try reinstalling the 2.3.2.1 package
