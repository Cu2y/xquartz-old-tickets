xterm and WM components placed under (obscured by) OS-X menu bar, inaccessible
==============================================================================


The xterm that launches by default before the window manager is placed with the top left corner underneath (obscured by) the OS-X menu bar, such that the drag bar and prompt of the xterm are under the OS-X menu bar, invisible and inaccessible.

Additionally, if the selected window manager has components at the top of the screen, those components will be invisible and inaccessible. For example, the Enlightenment window manager puts a thin horizontal bar at the top of the screen, which is a "grab bar" for the different workspaces. Under Apple's stock X11 implementation, Enlightenment would draw the grab bar just below OS-X's menu bar. Workspaces could be grabbed, moved as they were designed. Under the development X11 2.3.1, Enlightenment draws the grab bars underneath (obscured by) the OS-X menu bar, so they are invisible and inaccessible. I can switch workspaces other ways within the window manager, but this is a major impediment.

An interesting and possibly useful piece of information is that after the WM is running, when I create a new terminal window from within Enlightenment, the OS-X menu bar seems to be correctly detected -- the top of the new window is placed flush below it.

Discussed this on X11-users list and opening ticket at Jeremy's request.

This should be fixed in 2.3.2\_beta3 when I release it... or you can install 1.4.2-apple22 if you're impatient...
