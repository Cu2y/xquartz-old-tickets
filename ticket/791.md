Fullscreen Toggle
=================


I downloaded the beta version 2.75 and still there is the fullscreen toggle bug, will this ever be fixed? Also are there any work arounds to keep the xquartz fullscreen up?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *insufficient information*

What do you mean "the fullscreen toggle bug" ... as this is the first time this has been brought up, more information is certainly required.
