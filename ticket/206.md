Running "Xquartz -query" for XDMCP connection causes race-condition/hang
========================================================================


    when I run my saved alias of
    "/usr/X11R6/bin/Xquartz -query 10.1.2.59 -once" from Terminal.app I
    get this behaviour:

    a) The custom X11 logo bounces.
    b) the login window appears
    c) I can't focus the X11 or the login window by any means I've tried.
    d) I have to force-quite X11, which then relaunches itself without
    starting up the XDMCP connection or xterm, but other than that it
    seems normal (so I just quit it normally)
    e) I get the following output on the terminal:

    Xquartz: X11.app = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
    Xquartz: Starting X server:

    [at this point I Ctrl-C and then force-quit X11]

Your explanation on the ML...

I really don't know if this is directly related to this bug, but when using the workaround for this bug, once I switch focus away from X11, I can no longer get the XDMCP gnome window to pop to the front. I can \_focus\_ it by clicking on the gnome window or the X11 icon, but it doesn't pop to the front. I work around this by hiding all of my OS X apps so I can see the focused gnome window.

Here's the output on Terminal.app:

This should be usable in 2.3.2\_rc4 ... the xpbproxy stuff won't work, but I'm not sure the best way to get it working... At worse, you just see a bunch of error messages in the log file about pbproxy and the server behaves as it did before pbproxy was added.

Confirmed! The following commands works great now. (And I notice the white boxes are gone as well!)

/usr/X11/bin/X -query 10.1.2.59 -once

Possible Regression:

Now I have to click on the X11 icon twice to get the Gnome Desktop to come to the front. Should I file a separate bug for this, or is this expected behavior?

Hello,

I am new on this forum, but got here by searching google for the above mentioned problem. We have a unix computer at work with specific analysis software on it. I really need to be able to connect to this machine from my (and other) macs, but since leopard upgrade am not able to. My last try today (Xquartz version 2.3.2.1) reported something similar to the above mentioned problem.
You are talking about solutions and all, but i cannot find what the solution is. I am not a unix guru and know very little about terminal based computing, so please also explain what I have to type in the terminal?
Some further searching showed me that problems can arise when MacPorts is installed... maybe that information helps.

Hope someone can help me?

Thanks, reno
The Netherlands
