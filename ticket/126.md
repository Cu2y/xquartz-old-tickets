no magic cookies created at server startup
==========================================


reboot
login as user foo
fire-up a Terminal window

    $ xlsclients
    $ su - bar
    $ rm .Xauthority
    $ DISPLAY=:0 xlogo

The xlogo window pops-up even though I have the authenticate option set in
the preferences. It should not be possible for another user to do that on
the same machine unless they know the magic cookie.

If I do 'xauth list' I see that cookies never seem to be created for me.

This was with the 2.3.0-rc4 package.

The magic cookies seem to be created.

In fact, we are currently having the opposite problem where the first launched application can't connect because it doesn't know the authentication information when it tries to connect to the server...

What is the output of 'ps x | grep X11'?

I am doing this on a 1 GHz PPC G4 eMac, I can post what I find with intel later if you wish.

    /Users/mzs/.serverauth.11008: cannot open `/Users/mzs/.serverauth.11008' (No such file or directory)

I think I have updated X11 from xquartz.macosforge.org since when I reported this, but I am most likely not at the newest version. -version seems to have stopped working in both the binaries under /A and /usr so here is that info in another way (that is a side bug -version should still work and not try to start an Xserver):

    eMac:~ mzs$ strings /usr/X11/bin/X | head -7
    -version
    X.org Release 7.3
    X.Org X Server %s
    1.4.2-apple1
    Build Date: %s
    20080611

    Xquartz starting:
    X.Org X Server %s
    Build Date: %s
    1.4.2-apple1
    20080611

So you see on this machine at least no magic cookie is being created for :0, now for the actual worrisome part of the bug:

    eMac:~ mzs$ su - aga
    Password:
    eMac:~ aga$ rm .Xauthority
    rm: .Xauthority: No such file or directory
    eMac:~ aga$ DISPLAY=:0 xlogo

And up pops the xlogo window for user mzs from user aga.

Maybe you would like me to upgrade to some particular version. Reply with the url to a particular version you wish me to test. Possibly if you are not seeing it, the problem may now be fixed or at least different.

In the GUI X11 preferences under the Security tab, it shows Authenticate connections as checked and Allow connections from network clients as unchecked.

Here is another thing I noticed. I thought maybe it has something to do with an .Xauthority file being there vs not.

    eMac:~ mzs$ rm .Xauthority 
    eMac:~ mzs$ xlsclients
    eMac:~ mzs$ xauth list
    xauth:  creating new authority file /Users/mzs/.Xauthority
    eMac:~ mzs$ file .Xauthority
    .Xauthority: cannot open `.Xauthority' (No such file or directory)

Regardless of this the user aga can still get an xlogo on mzs's DISPLAY. The oddity is that xauth list did not create the .Xauthority file. xauth add creates an .Xauthority file just fine though.

That second case always happens... so I wouldn't worry about that...

I get:
~ $ /usr/X11/bin/X -version
X.org Release 7.3
X.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple4
Build Date: 20080710

... so I dunno what you're doing that is not working with -version... in any case, just go ahead and install the latest 2.3.0-rc6 release to make sure everything is up to snuff...

What filesystem is your home directory on?

So it seems that it is HFSX case sensitive. Also -version does indeed work, again I am a moron. Finally I will install 2.3.0-rc6 tonight and see what happens regarding all this tonight and leave a comment.

Here the other user is unable to use DISPLAY=:0 since admin does not know the cookie:

    Error: Can't open display: :0

What also is interesting is that for mzs the .Xauthority file is created with the correct entry for DISPLAY=:0. Also I see the problem Jeremy was alluding to in the earlier comment about the first client having trouble connecting.

I have upgraded to 2.3.0-rc6 on the ppc eMac and I still have the problem. Just in case I moved my ~/.xinitrc out of the way and I tried it again and I get the same results. Fortunately there are some interesting console messages. What is org.x.startx? Why is it trying to put cookies into some . serverauth.\# file? Why is that failing? Why is not the startx script doing this stuff and simply using the .Xauthority file?:

org.x.startx is the launchd service name for startx. IE, anything you see in the console log that is from org.x.startx is resulting from startx being run... so it IS startx... hence the name.

The .serverauth file is being used because that is how the rest of the X11 world does things and we don't see a compelling reason to do it otherwise.

I'm curious about these error messages from xauth... can you put some debugging info (like echos, etc) into /usr/X11/bin/startx to see why that is happening?

PS Try 2.3.0-rc7

I tried 2.3.0-rc7 and it did not fix the problem so then I poked around in startx and found out what was going on. The problem was largely on my end, I'll detail that later. With the 2.3.0-rc7 version the first xlsclients is able to connect, so I think that other problem that Jeremy first brought-up has been fixed (regarding the first client to connect).

Now about what was going on with my machine. I had a shell script ~/bin/hexdump. This was from the days that I largely used Solaris and FreeBSD and from a range of scripts I wrote to make them more similar to me. Then I munged that script to make it understand something called the classic protocol and dump that out better as well. So what I just did is I renamed it to classicdump and all is well now. In startx this did not work as expected with my script:

    mcookie=`dd if=/dev/urandom bs=16 count=1 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e \\"%08x\\"`

because the output was looking more like xxd or od. Maybe there should be an exit status check here:

        trap "rm -f '$xserverauthfile'" HUP INT QUIT ILL TRAP KILL BUS TERM
        xauth -q -f "$xserverauthfile" << EOF
    add :$dummy . $mcookie
    EOF

The other thing is that could be improved here is an "echo .... | xauth " could be used. Here docs actually make short tmp files and there should be no escaping needed.

I really don't know what to do though. I would say this was a mistake on my part. Maybe this startx has been modified enough from the templates from Xorg that the paths can be used such as /usr/bin/hexdump, or maybe PATH could be reset at the start of the script, but I really think this was simply a cock-up on my end with picking a stupid name for my shell script.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Great! I'm glad we figured out the problem =)
