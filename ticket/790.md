Install Failure on OSX 10.8.5
=============================


Installing either package 2.7.4 or the latest 2.7.5 (rc2), the screen in Installer for selecting destination has only one option - install for all users of this computer. All well and good, but it's eternally grayed out. I waited 5 minutes and it stayed unclickable. Furthermore, trying to install via

    sudo installer -pkg Xquartz.pkg -target /

gives me the following errors:

    installer: Cannot install on volume / because it is disabled.
    installer: This update requires you to first update your system to OS-X 10.6.3

It seems it doesn't recognize 10.8.5 as a valid version. Can an update be released ASAP to support this?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

If this is a real bug, it is an installer bug and not an XQuartz bug.
