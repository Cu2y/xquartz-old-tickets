fink problems
=============


Fink acually hangs when I try to install tetex. I run OS X 10.5.4 and installed X11 2.3.0 without installing Apple's X11.

Also, installing xpdf through Fink actually installs everything except the executable.

Also, when a single xterm is running, I see that top returns nearly 100% CPU usage for that xterm.

Ctrl-Ding the second of two xterms causes the firts (that comes up with X11 on start) to also quit.

Finally, when I add the line "exec bash" to my .profile. X11 refuses to come up and just hangs without starting.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

ok...

1) Report fink issues to fink.
2) The 100% cpu issue is a known kernel bug and not related to X11
3) The exec bash in your .profile is giving you an infinite loop. execing bash causes .profile to be sourced, thus execing bash causing the .profile to be sourced ...
