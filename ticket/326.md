shift-space being swallowed in XQuartz 2.4.1\_alpha3
====================================================


&lt;shift-space&gt; (i.e. pressing the spacebar while holding shift) while in an xterm or Eterm (or presumably any other X11 app) gets swallowed.

Expected behavior: a space should be emitted (as in Apple's X11 on Snow Leopard, and previous versions).

Jeremy already provided a workaround in IRC:
echo keycode 57 = space space | xmodmap -

I'm considering this "major" because it affected usability enough for me to need to go back to the old X server.

This problem is also evident for shift-enter. Shift-backspace is OK.

I added "keycode 44 = KP\_Enter KP\_Enter" to my .Xmodmap to fix this one...

Spoke too soon; that was the wrong fix... "keycode 44 = Return Return" works better.
