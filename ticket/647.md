No VisibilityNotify Events being created
========================================


My application has multiple windows created with the following EventMask: ExposureMask | VisibilityChangeMask | StructureNotifyMask | FocusChangeMask | ButtonPressMask | PointerMotionMask | ButtonReleaseMask | KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask. I expect to get a VisibilityNotify Event when one window of my application starts to obscure another. On MacOSX (using multiple different XQuartz version), i get never a VisibilityNotify event (the same code thought works on other OSes: Linux, Solaris, ...).

I want to use the VisibilityNotify event to change the stacking order of the windows when a Warning panel gets hidden by another window. Is there another option to do that? \_NET\_STATE\_ABOVE or similar to define on-top windows is not supported on XQuartz as well. Is there any notification by XQuartz when the window stacking order is changed, i can hook in?

Are you trying to do this for modal windows or some other reason?

sorry for the late answer, the notification email seem to got lost.

I am doing that for modal + floating windows.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
