Can't download xquartz
======================


I am a crafter trying to download xquartz (its required for inkscape). The download estimate showed days not hours, so I just left it run overnight thinking it would get over its hump and then pick-up. Well, over 12 hours later, it only downloaded 42kb.
Help please!
