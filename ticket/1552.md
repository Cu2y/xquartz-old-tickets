XQUARTZ TAKES TOO LONG TO COME UP ON MAVRICKS
=============================================


Starting xquartz causes a very prolonged period of messages to console complaining that the xquartz x11 server cannot be found.
This goes on and on for 30 minutess or more before it start successfully.

Why would this occur?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Cannot Reproduce*

Works for me and many other users. Nothing in startup has changed (in OS X or XQuartz) for about 4 years.

Why do you have "/Applications/Utilities/old XQuartz/Old\_Mar12-2014\_XQ.app/Contents/MacOS/X11"

I suggest you delete "/Applications/Utilities/old XQuartz", reinstall, reboot, and try again. Ask for help on x11-users if you still have issues.
