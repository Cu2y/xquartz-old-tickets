Not working on my MacBookAir june2012
=====================================


Hi,

I've just tried to download the latest Xquartz version to make it run with R and when I try to download it it says "Error with the download, the file can not be registered because the sourcefile can not be read. Retry later or contact the administrator of the server"

Can you help me with that ?

Kind Regards

Julien Barthassat

That's an error on your end. Your download probably didn't complete...
