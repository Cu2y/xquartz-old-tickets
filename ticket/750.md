XQuartz crshes in DRICopyWindow
===============================


Crashes when opening the application xcrysden, which previously was working fine. I noticed this after the April update to xcode. The same thing happens when trying to open an x window remotely from an ubuntu machine (gvim or also xcrysden).

Opening gvim locally also works as well as other things like gnuplot, xmgrace.
