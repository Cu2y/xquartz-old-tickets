focus-follows-mouse fails in version 2.5.0 for Snow Leopard
===========================================================


focus-follows-mouse is not working on XQuartz.app (although it works on X11.app).

Excerpted from 'defaults read org.x.X11':

> "startx\_script" = "/usr/X11/bin/startx";

> "sync\_keymap" = 1;

> "wm\_click\_through" = 0;

> "wm\_ffm" = 1;

> "wm\_focus\_on\_new\_window" = 1;

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

On Snow Leopard, we are releasing X11 in a different location, so it's a different id than the native X11 (org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 rather than org.x.X11). Just set it via the preference pane.
