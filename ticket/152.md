Odd Caps-lock behaviour
=======================


Currently XQuartz shows the following behaviour when using the caps-lock key:

Starting with caps-lock off:
Press caps-lock: Letters in upper-case as expected
Press caps-lock: Letters still in upper-case - BAD
Press caps-lock: Letters in upper case (as expected)
Press caps-lock: Letters back to lower case - GOOD
