Keyboard remapped in both NX and OpenNX clients
===============================================


I know this issue has been discussed before, but it seems to have cropped up again using the newest version of Xquarz on Snow Leopard. Here are the particulars in my case -

SYSTEM:
Mac mini,
4 GB RAM.
Apple clear/white keyboard,
XQuartz 2.6.3,
Snow Leopard 10.6.8

CLIENT SOFTWARE TRIED:
NX client version 3.5.0-7,
OpenNX client version 0.16.0.649

SERVER SYSTEM:
Ubuntu 10.10
FreeNX server

Keyboard is completely remapped, here are some examples (Apple on left, NX client system on right:
RETURN = j
m = c
n=x
DEL = ,
g = 4
h = 3

-   = \]

q = -

I have tried starting the X11 server first, as suggested in earlier solutions to this problem with previous Xquartz versions, but it has not helped this time. Since this happens identically using either the official NX client from Nomachine.com and the OpenNX client, it must be do to something in the way Xquartz is passing the keyboard information to the FreeNX server system. Both the NX client and the OpenNX client worked before I installed XQuartz 2.6.3 (using the Apple version of X11).

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

From what I've been told, this is a bug in NX. If you have an xterm running right next to it, or you have 'xinput test keyboard' running in another terminal, they both get the correct data.
