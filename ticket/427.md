use of xmodmap can break tilde key
==================================


This bug may be related to closed ticket [\#⁠370](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/370). It appears in XQuartz 2.5.2 running on an Intel iMac with OS 10.6.4 using a standard wired keyboard.

Use of xmodmap to re-map the keyboard can result in the inability to enter a tilde or backtick into a window. The problem does not exist in XQuartz 2.3.5 (and earlier), but now appears in XQuartz 2.5.2 now that the bug in ticket [\#⁠370](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/370) has been fixed.

The following xmodmap command sequence generates the problem:

clear mod2
keysym Meta\_L = Control\_L
keysym Meta\_R = Control\_R
add control = Control\_L
add control = Control\_R

Note that this remapping does not deal directly with the tilde key, nor does it create difficulties with any other keys. (The remapping simply makes the "apple" key a control key and this remapping sequence has worked over many generations of X11.) I believe it is sufficient to have the "keysym" lines above to produce the bug.

Once this xmodmap sequence is executed, the tilde key cycles through windows instead of entering the symbol. The use of key modifiers seems to make no difference.

The problem is that you don't have any Meta modifiers left... That's going to cause all kinds of problems in other applications too. Here, you can switch the old control keycodes to be meta.

    keycode 63 = Control_L
    keycode 71 = Control_R
    keycode 67 = Meta_L
    keycode 70 = Meta_R
    clear control
    clear mod2
    add control = Control_L Control_R
    add mod2 = Meta_L Meta_R

A fix has been identified and will be included in 2.5.3 (it's not in the just released 2.6.0\_alpha1 since this report came in just after its release). Thanks for your report.
