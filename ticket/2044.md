XQuartz only honors keyboard mapping at startup
===============================================


If I start X11 with Dvorak set the only way to switch to Qwerty is to restart X11 after changing the keyboard mapping in the OS X settings. Of course I can't use setxkbmap to move between mappings because that crashes with a divide by zero error.
