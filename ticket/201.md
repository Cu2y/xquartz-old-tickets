X starts up with / as current directory
=======================================


X11 starts up with / as its current directory, so that xterms started from the window manager also start in /. It would be more convenient to start in the user's home directory (as was the case in Tiger).

A simple workaround is to put "cd $HOME" in your .xinitrc.
