Xquartz replacing X11
=====================


I downloaded v2.7.4, installed it with lion os x but when I initiate the application that used the form X11 program, I still get an error message 'X11 cannot be found' seem the application does not recognize the new or replacement version for X11.

Yeah, this has already been reported to Wireshark.

If you're seeing this in another application, file a bug with them. They've been broken since Leopard.
