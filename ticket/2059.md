Applications Menu not working
=============================


I have just installed XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2) under OS X 10.10 and have found that the Applications Menu no longer works, not even for terminal.
I can activate programs from the xterm window.

The version I selected in the drop down list is wrong but having selected it, I couldn't delete it.
The correct Version is 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2) for which there does not appear to be a selection.

Seems to be fixed.
Probably due to my .profile file not being loaded as a result of an Anaconda installation messing things up which I have now corrected!
Please close as invalid or fixed or as appropriate.
