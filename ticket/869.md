XQuartz crashing
================


Hi,

XQuartz is crashing every couple of minutes (though not exactly at regular intervals)
under 10.9.1. I'm attaching a log from the crash.

Best,
Detmar

I had a look at the crash2.txt log I added and the crashed thread is the one including

4 X11.bin 0x000000010005b590 SecurityDeleteAuthorization + 378
5 X11.bin 0x00000001000e6019 doFreeResource + 105
6 X11.bin 0x00000001000e5f8b FreeResource + 200
7 X11.bin 0x000000010005c798 SecurityAuthorizationExpired + 52

So the expiring security authorization may be what is behind the regularly occurring crashes I observed? But what security authorization is it and why does it expire here - and is it a mistake that the resource is freed then (presumably leading to the crash - just brainstorming, I know far too little about this, but perhaps it's a useful starting point)?

Best,
Detmar

Odd. How reproducible is this? I've never seen a failure at that point. Is it still an issue with newer servers?

Ping.

I also just emailed xorg-devel about this and am curious if a change that is in 1.15.x (and thus in 2.7.7 beta1 and later) addresses the issue:

Please verify fixed in the final 2.7.7 once it is available.
