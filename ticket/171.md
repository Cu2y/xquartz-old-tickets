XGetImage() fails for GL windows
================================


I'm porting an X11 application to OS X and there's a section of code that uses XGetImage() to get the color of the pixel below the mouse cursor (i.e. XGetImage(dpy,d,x,y,1,1,...) ). This works as expected unless the cursor happens to be over a GL window in which case it simply returns the X window background color.

Unfortunately this is a known problem. The way that the Xplugin surfaces work with OpenGL and XQuartz is that they are layered above the actual window used for X11 rendering, so the surface stacks above the other memory for the window. When you call XGetImage you get none of the actual OpenGL content. I have some ideas for working around this that I have experimented with, but nothing concrete the completely solves the problem. For now, you can work around it with glReadPixels and things like that.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
