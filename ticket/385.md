Command-\` hangs all X11 windows
================================


Using the keyboard shortcut to switch windows among a single application (command-\`) causes all open X11 windows to become unresponsive to input, including clicks to change window focus. Applications are sometimes still updating (flash text-entry cursor), sometimes not (xeyes no longer track). Expose can still bring windows back to the foreground.

To recreate: launch xterm, launch xeyes, use command-\` to swtich between the two. Hang should occur.
