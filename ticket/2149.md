XQuartz windows disappearing from Yosemite second monitor
=========================================================


I have Yosemite 10.10.4 and XQuartz 2.7.7 running Inkscape. I have a secondary 1080p monitor plugged in to Thunderbolt. When I start Inkscape, the window may or may not appear depending on where it was when I last shut it down. If Inkscape was last used on my laptop window, then it will appear successfully there. I can then successfully move it to my secondary monitor. Now when I try to maximize the window, it grows to the right size, but about 120 pixels too low. Moving it up to a proper position sometimes works, but sometimes the window snaps back to the low position. Trying again to move the window, or maximizing again intermittently causes the window to disappear.

Once the window disappears, it shows up in Mission Control but cannot be retrieved. Within Mission Control, it can be moved from the secondary monitor to the laptop screen, but it will still be missing from both monitors when I come out of Mission Control. Restarting Inkscape and X11 will not retrieve the window; it starts up on the second monitor mission control, but not on screen. Logging out and back in has the same effect. Disconnecting the secondary monitor causes the window to reappear on the laptop screen, maximized but still too low. Reconnecting the secondary monitor causes it to disappear again.

This lost window state can also be achieved simply by shutting down Inkscape while it is on the secondary monitor. The next time Inkscape is started up, the window will be on the second monitor in mission control, but not on screen.

WORKAROUND
A workaround similar to that described in [ticket:1\#comment:15](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1#comment:15) is successful in retreiving the window:

1.  Unplug the secondary monitor, causing the window to appear on the primary
2.  Click on their top bar and hold (as if you were dragging the window around). Don't let go.
3.  Plug in the secondary monitor while holding the top bar.
4.  Drag window to secondary monitor.

Sorry, that should be [ticket:796\#comment:15](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/796#comment:15)
I don't know how to edit that.
