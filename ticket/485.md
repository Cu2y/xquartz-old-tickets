xemacs focus problem
====================


MacOS 10.6.7 and using Macports xemacs 21.4.22, and XQ 2.6.0, the xemacs window gets the focus, so if you start typing it goes into the xemacs window.
With XQ 2.6.1 focus still works as expected.

With XQ 2.6.2 and 2.6.3RC1, when xemacs starts there is no window with focus.
The Window column shows xterm2 has the tick, but when you type no window
echoes the characters.
With 2.6.3RC1 it does sometimes work as expected, starting xemacs enough
times about less than 50%.

It is not a big deal, as you just need one click on the xemacs window to regain focus,
but it may be a sympton of some broader problem ?

Can you please verify that this is an issue with quartz-wm by doing the following:

1) Install 2.6.1

2) Backup quartz-wm

    sudo cp /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm-2.6.1

3) Install 2.6.3\_rc1

4) Use the old quartz-wm

    sudo cp /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm-2.6.3_rc1
    sudo cp /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm-2.6.1 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/485#comment:2):
Sorry this got lost. We made the jump to Lion and 2.7 beta now, so this can be closed.

Still have to click to focus in Mac 10.7.2 clean install, and 2.7b2
Not a problem for us, if that how it will stay.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.7.1* to *2.7.0*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Closing as fixed in 2.7.0 per above.

Yes, I understand this is still an issue for you in the Lion quartz-wm, but this is tracking the fix in XQuartz, not OS X.
