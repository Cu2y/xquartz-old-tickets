Wine test suite crashes X server with SIGBUS
============================================


I'm building Wine on my Macbook Pro, but somewhere in the test suite the X server completely crashes.

Occurs in 2.3.3.2 and 2.4.0 rc1.

Wine source checked out from <git://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git>

commit 578aeb87b59b04a85db6e8e545a6065cfab8a79b
Author: Alexandre Julliard &lt;<julliard@winehq.org>&gt;
Date: Fri Jul 17 18:38:57 2009 +0200

> Release 1.1.26.

The test that crashes is:

./wine ./dlls/user32/tests/user32\_test.exe.so win

It's not crashing every time, but at least 1 out of 2.

The Wine output before the crash is:

win.c:590: main: WM\_WINDOWPOSCHANGING 0x20034 after 0x0, x -32769, y -40000, cx 0, cy 0 flags 00000002

X connection to /tmp/launch-0NHaKn/:0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

It could be that the change event triggers a redraw, that is just exactly right to break the Bresenham algorithm.

I added a trace for the LineTo function:

I can reproduce it, but interestingly the crash is in a different location for me. I see it in another memcpy...

It's definitely some kind of memory management / bounds issue... these are ugly.

I'm going to spend some time trying to figure it out in 2.4.0, but it won't block the release since it is not a regression.

I get the exact same backtrace (about fbBresSolid &lt;- RootlessPolySegment) as the OP, running XQuartz 2.3.3.2 on an "early 2009" Mac OS mini with OSX 10.5.7.

In wine/dlls/user32/tests/win.c, wine performs boundary checking:

> SetWindowPos(hwnd, 0, -32769, -40000, -32769, -90000, SWP\_NOMOVE);
> SetWindowPos(hwnd, 0, 32768, 40000, 32768, 40000, SWP\_NOMOVE);

> SetWindowPos(hwnd, 0, -32769, -40000, -32769, -90000, SWP\_NOSIZE);
> SetWindowPos(hwnd, 0, 32768, 40000, 32768, 40000, SWP\_NOSIZE);

When I comment out the second call, the tests run without crash. Otherwise, X11.app crashes every time.

The testsuite only crashes in fullscreen (rootless) mode. when Wine runs inside a virtual desktop window, there's no crash.

Just to be certain, please verify that this occurs on 2.5.0

It does not. At least, not with a 64-bit X server. Throwing more memory at the problem certainly helps :).

Can't test with a 32-bit server yet. I'm on battery at the moment, so I can't build Wine (at least, not without draining the battery).

The 32-bit server doesn't crash either.
