applications blank on second screen
===================================


This may not be due to x11, but applications such as gimp and inkscape which rely on xquartz ar blank on my second screen since I updated to 2.6.3. Which was right after I updated to lion. See the attached files. The first is a screenshot of my left monitor with part of the application showing, the second is my right monitor with the blacked out part of the application. Curiously if I take a screenshot of just the application though there is no blackening (third image).
Thanks, CS
