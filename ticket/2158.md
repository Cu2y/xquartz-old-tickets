XQuartz randomly crashes on OS X Yosemite10.10.5
================================================


It was happening once every couple of weeks, right after Yosemite started
Today it crashed 2 times in less than 2 hours and I'm not happy.
My whole work has been and still depends heavily on using XQuartz for the last 8 years and this started happening a couple of months ago. It happens randomly, not even clicking or using its terminals, it happens totally ramdon...

Any help is highly appreciated...
