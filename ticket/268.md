X11 won't launch if there is an error in the shell's startup script
===================================================================


For example, with zsh, if you put this in .zlogin

echo "oops, something wrong in .zlogin"
exit 2

X11 won't start, and the echo (along with all other .zlogin output) goes to the Console app.

Instead, the echo should go to the terminal window, and the window should be made inactive (because there is no active shell).

If you make an executable shellscript.command file with an exit command in it and double-click it, you will see how Terminal.app handles this.

0 343 Z% cat &gt; shellscript.command
\#!/bin/sh

echo exiting
exit 2
0 344 Z% chmod a+rx shellscript.command
0 345 Z% open shellscript.command
0 346 Z%

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

This is the correct behavior. You have a misunderstanding about the behavior of the .zlogin script. It is SOURCED in the shell which means that if it exits, you don't get a shell. it is not RUN by the shell. Those are two entirely different behaviors.

I read this bug report as, "If I break my system, then it's broken." ... so don't break your .login script.

BTW, what you want to do is change the exit to a return.
