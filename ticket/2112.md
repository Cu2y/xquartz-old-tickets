Mouse rendered double size
==========================


At some point - and I'm not sure what the trigger was - when connecting to a linux machine via SSH with X forwarding and using applications like kwrite, kdevelop, and so on, the mouse began to be displayed at double size. With an I-bar cursor, it's not apparent where the hot spot is, and even when the mouse is a pointer, it's downright annoying.

The issue didn't go away after the next XQuartz update, so I assumed that it arose from a software update having delivered the defect to the linux side, but it never resolved itself through further updates. Recently, I got a new linux box and hoped that the oversized mouse would go away. Unfortunately, it didn't which would indicate that the probably actually lies with XQuartz. None of the preferences in XQuartz suggest that they would have anything to do with it. The mac has a retina display, but the oversized mouse occurs regardless of whether the X window is on the retina display or on my external monitor.

The version popup menu below isn't populated for some reason, so I'll mention here that this is with XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2), but the issue originally appeared one or two versions back.

Well if the X11 application requests drawing a large cursor, we'll draw a large cursor. I think the problem is likely with the applications you're running.
