In fullscreen mode, changing space should not change X11
========================================================


Steps to reproduce:

    1) Enter full screen mode, open xterm
    2) Return to Aqua, change space
    3) Reenter full screen X11

You will notice that xterm has been left on the previous space, and there is no way to find it again in X11. Furthermore, if one has virtual desktops in X11, changing desktop in one aqua space results in changing desktop in all aqua spaces:

    4) Change virtual desktop
    5) Return to aqua's initial space where X11 was created and reenter fullscreen

After working in aqua for awhile, it is easy (for me) to forget what space I started out in, and it is very annoying to have to check all of them to find which one X11 is on.

This is the intended behavior. I'm sorry you don't like it this way =/

If you keep everything in one space, and you use the spaces preference to move to the space with active windows, you should automatically move to the space with X11. It doesn't make sense to always move X11 to your space.

I understand why this happens; it makes perfect sense if you don't use fullscreen mode. Unfortunately it results in totally incorrect behavior when fullscreen mode is used. Since this wasn't always the case, is a preference possible? Using the 'jump to a new space when changing application focus' really really annoys me. I was one of the angry hordes filing bug reports with Apple as soon as Leopard came out about this. Thankfully they put in a preference to disable it in later releases.

It's not "totally incorrect behavior" ... when I use fullscreen mode, I still want to use different spaces, and I switch to them just like I do with my OSX applications (ctrl-\#, ctrl-arrow, or the menu bar).
