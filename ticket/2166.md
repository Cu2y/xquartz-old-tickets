XQuartz 2.7.7 stuck during installation
=======================================


I downloaded XQuartz 2.7.7 and tried to install it on my mac. But when I reached "select a destination" the installation process seems stuck and cannot continue.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

You likely need to wait or click. Either way, it's not a bug of the package. If anything, it would be an OS X bug.
