mac os 10.7 to linux server
===========================


Hello,
I'm mac user, os 10.7.4 and Xquartz 2.7.2, i would like to connect with a linux server with this command : x : 28 query 192.168.0.101 but i can't.
This command matched with the old system 10.5.8 and X 11 2.1.4.
Have you a solution for me ?
