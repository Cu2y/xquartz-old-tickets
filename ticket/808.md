Alternate PC Keyboard not used on Mac OS X Mavericks
====================================================


Hi,

> With Mavericks, a new feature allow you to use a PC keyboard layout with your macbook.

> See this post to activate it : <http://blog.mansonthomas.com/2013/10/using-pc-keyboard-layout-on-mac-os-x.html>

> So if you use a French PC keyboard layout (instead of French keyboard layout), ssh to a linux server, launch KeepassX (password manager) or Firefox, and try typing some non alphabetic character like '+' you'll get a '\_' (which is the correct character for the normal french keyboard layout).

> So somehow, Quartz ignore the currently set keyboard layout and use the default one, which is problematic when you try to type a password ;)

Regards,
Thomas.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

My guess is that you have "Follow system keyboard layout" disabled in preferences and you changed your layout after launching XQuartz.

XQuartz builds the keymap by querying the OS X keymap. If this issue is real (you have that option enabled), then it is a bug in OS X.
