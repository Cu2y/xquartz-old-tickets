XQuartz X11 forwarding not working in OS X 10.10 Yosemite
=========================================================


I'm sure this is a bug specific to OS X 10.10 beta, but I will start this thread for other users experiencing this issue.

When connecting to a ssh server using X forwarding, I get some warnings and errors. Here is the example output:

    [~]$ ssh -X my_name@server_ip
    Warning: untrusted X11 forwarding setup failed: xauth key data not generated
    Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.

    X connection to localhost:23.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

    /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.sI1o0yhO1s/org.macosforge.xquartz: unknown host. (nodename nor servname provided, or not known)

I removed XQuartz, rebooted, reinstalled XQuartz, and rebooted again - no change.

Any suggestions? Thanks!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *OSX*
-   **Resolution** set to *Fixed*

This has nothing to do with XQuartz. It's a bug in OpenSSH.

I fixed it in MacPorts' openssh port in <https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/net/openssh/files/launchd.patch?rev=121205> and the fix for OS X's OpenSSH should be in the latest beta.
