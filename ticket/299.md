nedit crashes on cut or paste
=============================


I am using 2.4.0 on a MacPro Intel running OS X 10.5.8.

Every time I try to cut or paste using nedit, it crashes with a bus error. This happens with crtl-v, ctrl-c, or using the menu items.
Clicking sometimes pastes correctly.

Can you please repost the logs uncompressed.

Can you please try using the 1.4.2-apple47 server:

    curl -LO http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47.bz2
    bunzip2 X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47.bz2
    sudo mv /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin.bak
    sudo cp X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin 
    sudo chmod 755 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin 

Then restart X11.app

FYI, it appears the nedit crash was being caused by a bug in lesstif which the fink nedit was built against.

    Date: Thu, 27 Aug 2009 23:39:54 -0400
    From: Jack Howarth <howarth@bromo.med.uc.edu>
    To: xquartz-dev@lists.macosforge.org
    Subject: [Xquartz-dev] X11 2.4.0 vs nedit 5.6-cvs20081118


       I have been trying to solve some issues with the lesstif-0.95.2
    and nedit fink packages on i386, powerpc and x86_64. I believe I 
    have solved the lesstif 0.95.2 bus errors (which was due to missing
    braces from a debian patch accepted upstream)...

This seems to have resolved the cut or paste crashes (ie, it really appears to be a lesstif problem).

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

I pushed the patch to MacPorts a while back as well.
