XQuartz update 2.7.7 doesn't terminate on Yosemite
==================================================


XQuartz update from an installed XQuartz 2.7.6 does correctly complete
on Mavericks (10.9.5).

On Yosemite (10.10) the same update process doesn't complete.
Moreover the process hangs at the end of the "Extracting update..." step.

The disk image is correctly loaded and mounted within /Volumes,
but no error is displayed.

I think this might be a bug between the Finder and te way the XQuartz
update communicate with it.
I submitted a bug report to Apple.

There's not really anything that we can do about this.

FWIW, it woks fine here. You should look at a spindump and syslog to see what is happening on your system. Maybe check fs\_usage as well.

fs\_usage is displaying a continuous flow of pread and pwrite coming from threads of X11.bin
(about 300 per second, on F=42 & 43))
and since I'm looking at all this through an xterm process (running fs\_usage)
a quite normal flow of select, ioctl & recvmsg from xterm.

Yes. That would be expected. I assume those descriptors are sockets to X11 clients (eg: the xterm that you're communicating with)

The update hanging problem is a known bug in Sparkle. You just need to install the update manually.
