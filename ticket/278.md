high cpu usage after launching X11 2.3.3.2
==========================================


Just a few seconds after launching X11, I notice that my system start to overheat (no other apps are running). If I look a the system monitor, I can see the CPU graph all green (100% user cpu usage) But in the task list, no process is using more than 3% cpu time. If I shut down X11, the CPU continue to run at full speed. I must restart the system to get it normal again.
This is very strange because "sudo top" does not show me a hungry process, but my machine is hot and the fans at full speed (macbookpro core duo) Only the System monitor graph shows a full cpu activity.

I'm running OS 10.5.7, latest updates. I have made a clean install of my system a few weeks ago.

Can I provide more informations to help?

Do you have a tablet?
Did you reinstall X11 after updating to 10.5.7?

Can you please sample the X11 process.

After running top, make sure you hit 'o' then type '-cpu' then enter to sort by cpu usage.

I have a wacom tablet, I installed the drivers just after X11 2.3.3.2.
I have made a clean install of 10.5 with complete formatting of the hdd, not an update.
I have installed X2.1 (as I remember) then X2.3.3.2 (yesterday) and then the Wacom Driver.

Ok, thank you for learning me to use Top ;) Now I can tell that the faulty process is aslmanager. I found this : <http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1831184>
Perhaps there is no link between X11 and aslmanager, but I rebooted 3 times, launched X11, and each time aslmanager start to eat all my cpu time.

after that i followed the steps explained in the link above :
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.aslmanager
sudo mv /var/log/asl/\* ~/tmp (you might as well use rm but i wanted to be safe)
sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd

And tried to restart X11. aslmanager is quiet now. I tried to reboot and start X11 again, no trace of aslmanager. Everything is ok...
