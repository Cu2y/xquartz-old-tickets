Issue with overlapping Safari and X11 windows
=============================================


I'm able to make this happen with a limited amount of repeatability at the moment, but this is happening with:

1) I have (at least) two Safari windows open: one on my main display, and one on a second display.

2) I have an X11 window open on my main display which overlaps the Safari window there (may or may not be in front of the Safari window).

3) From the state of Safari window on the second display having app and window focus, I click on X11 window on the main display.

The result is the X11 window and X11 app gain focus on the main display, but sometimes the Safari window on the main display appears in front of the X11 window (may stay in front, or may move to being in front if it was behind).

Of note, I observe that whenever I switch from Safari on the second display to X11 on the main display, Safari appears to quickly re-draw its front-most window in the main display and I can see that during the moment of re-draw, that Safari window gets window focus as the top-left buttons gain red-yellow-green color briefly. My \*guess\* is that this sometimes occurs \*after\* X11 has gained application focus and has redrawn its X11 window. So perhaps the bug is with Safari's window re-draw happening late, or perhaps X11 isn't giving Safari sufficient time to sort itself out. Maybe there's a hand-off signal that's being ignored by one or the other (I don't know these details).

It may very well be that I will not be able to replicate the issue again if asked to do so. I would't be surprised if there is something relevant about this current situation which I have failed to document. But I would be willing to try just about any tests asked of me if it would help.

I'm using X11 2.7.6, OS X 10.9.3, Safari 7.0.4 on a 2010 MacBook Pro using the dedicated GPU.

Thanks,
-Gene

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
