inconsistent window stacking order after space change
=====================================================


Create a couple of overlapping X11 windows. Flip from this space to another space and back, repeatedly (I'm doing this with control-downarrow then control-uparrow). It seems to be about a fifty-fifty bet which window will be shown as on top of the other during any given visit to the space. Focus order seems to be preserved, though, which means that sometimes you can click on what is shown as the top window and have your click delivered to the one underneath (which had been the top window before you started flipping).

If you throw some non-X11 windows into the mix (I'm trying it with Safari) things get weirder still. I haven't entirely characterized the behavior, but stacking order relative to the non-X windows is unstable too.

2.2.1 not 2.2.0

Hm, no, it's not so random as all that: after doing a whole bunch of space-switch cycles, it seems that the stacking order is shown correctly two times out of three and incorrectly every third time. I'd have preferred "random" --- this is just weird.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** changed from *2.2.0 (xserver-1.3)* to *2.2.1 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.1*

Can you please give me precise instructions on how to reproduce this? I can't trigger it given what you have described.

Hmm, after logging out and in I can't reproduce the every-third-time business either. Will keep poking at it, but I wonder if it was related to one of the bugs I filed earlier today. In the meantime, here is a reproducible stacking-order misbehavior:

-   create a new standard user and log in as him

<!-- -->

-   enable Spaces via System Preferences, then quit System Preferences

<!-- -->

-   Open Applications/Utilities via Finder, drag X11 into Dock

> -- leave this Finder window open; on a big monitor, drag it up towards upper left corner of screen

-   Start X11 by clicking on Dock icon

<!-- -->

-   Command-N to open a second xterm

> -- at this point, second xterm is atop first is atop finder window

-   Control-down-arrow to move to space 3

<!-- -->

-   Mouse down on X11 icon in dock, pick Applications-&gt;Terminal

<!-- -->

-   Control-uparrow

<!-- -->

-   Control-downarrow

<!-- -->

-   Control-uparrow

I now see Finder window atop xterm 2 atop xterm 1, which is 100% backwards.

I can't reproduce this in 2.3.1. Please try 2.3.1\_rc5 and reopen if you're still having problems.
