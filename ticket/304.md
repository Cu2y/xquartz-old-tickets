REGRESSION: AIGLX: Open GL window does not refresh in subsequent runs after first run of X11.app using 2.4.0.
=============================================================================================================


X11 2.4.0 introduced an issue in which OpenGL windows created using the Geant4 radiation simulation package fail to open after the first run of X11.app. On the first run after opening X11 everything is normal. After the Geant4 program terminates and the window closes normally, a new window does not open if X11.app does not also terminate. Data is written to the X window and no program errors are encountered, but the screen display does not appear. It does appear if another X11 application such as xterm runs and opens its own window. In this case, the Geant4 window also appears with all data written into it correctly. The system also behaves normally if glxgears is run between two invocations of the Geant4 program. This problem does not appear when server 1.4.2-apple47 is used with the XQuartz 2.4.0 installation. I have attached an email file with the complete discussion between Jeremy Huddleston and me on this issue.

-   **Summary** changed from *Open GL window does not refresh in subsequent runs after first run of X11.app using 2.4.0.* to *REGRESSION: Open GL window does not refresh in subsequent runs after first run of X11.app using 2.4.0.*
-   **Keywords** *regression* added; *OpenGL*, *window*, *refresh* removed
-   **Milestone** changed from *2.5.1* to *OpenGL.framework DRI*

I expect this is still present in 2.5.0. Please verify that this is the case. Do you have any way that I can reproduce this problem? How do I get / use Geant4?

I believe this should be fixed with 2.6.3
