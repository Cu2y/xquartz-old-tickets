X11 location
============


Dear Team,

I downloaded Xquartz for the X11 to support my inkscape program. The problem I had is that the first time I opened Inkscape a dialog screen asked me to locate where the X11 files where and by mistake I pressed on the "System information" app in mac.

Now everytime I open inkscape it calls the files for X11 from that app and as it does not work it just closes inkscape and opens System Information. Giving no further option.

Do you have a clue on how to eliminate that link between the two apps?

Ask Inkscape developers. They shouldn't need that dialog at all. My guess is that you have a very old Inkscape version as the last OS that would need it was Tiger.
