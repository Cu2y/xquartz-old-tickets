Video Artifacting
=================


After installing xquartz 2.3.2.1 on osx client 10.5.6 we're getting some video artifacting while using an OpenGL application.

The main window of the app begins to flicker like crazy, after quitting the X11 or moving the main app window to the primary monitor the second monitor begins to artifact.

What version were you using prior to installing 2.3.2.1?

We had a base install of 10.5.6 and thus the X11 that came with 10.5.6, xquartz 2.3.2.1 was a fresh clean install onto this computer.

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?

What video card do you have? Is it an x1600, r600, or nv70?

I have had same issues with GDIS (i work with the developer) using osx 10.5.7. After trying all new xquartz releases including 2.4 etc beta releases, I worked in reverse order from the latest beta release to find that version 2.3.1 is the only version of xquartz that doesnt cause the flicker.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*

Can you please install 2.4.0-rc2 and use this script to find the server version delta that causes the problem:

    http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/browser/trunk/find_version_delta.sh?format=txt

You should edit it and change the LO to 17 and HI to 31 to match the version change between 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

After making that edit, run it like:

    $ sudo bash ./find_version_delta.sh

It will ask you to stop and restart the X11 server as it runs to test new versions. You should run it from Terminal.app because of this.

1.4.2-apple20 was the last to work
1.4.2-apple21 was the first to break

Is your application trying to use a stereo visual?

Did you try 2.4.0-rc2? It actually fixes up the GL code that was changed between 20 and 21.

Can you also try the 1.4.2-apple47 server?

*jordan@…* commented *[on Aug 12, 2009](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/237#comment:18 "August 12, 2009 at 2:51 PM PDT")*

Yes I tried 2.4.0-rc2. No the app is not trying to do stereo. I can try apple47 server will report back tomorrow.

I was having this problem with GDIS too. It seems to work fine (no artifacting) under Snow Leopard (XQuartz 2.3.4 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple)) now. I also had the same results with as jordan with find\_version\_delta.sh

SL is 1.4.2-apple45, so it looks like it should be fixed in 1.4.2-apple47. Can you please try 1.4.2-apple47 and confirm that assumption.

Do you know where to get the apple47 file? <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/archive/X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47.bz2> results in a 404

Same problem as before.

Installed X11-2.4.0 with apple47.

Please try 1.4.2-apple45 (the version shipped with SL, which you said worked...)

If that fails in Leopard, then this is just something that is outside the scope of X11 and fixed in SL.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** changed from *OpenGL.framework DRI* to *SnowLeopard*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Ok, then this is an issue in drivers that were fixed in SL... I have no way of actually working around that in Leopard... so closing as fixed in SL.

Thanks.
