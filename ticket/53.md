Got Kopete tooltips while Safari on foreground
==============================================


I am running Kopete (Fink version) and current X11. While it was in background (out of focus, sight, not hidden), I was browsing a site and I saw Kopete tooltips appearing instead of Safari link tooltips. When I hide Safari (Apple+H), I saw Kopete was at same area of the tooltips appearing.

I had to check X11 version from its "About" menu right now and can't reproduce to provide a screenshot. Sorry for that.
