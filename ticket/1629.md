Why no "Paste" menu item in XQuartz?
====================================


As I am using XQuartz daily for a dwm environment I was always wondering why I am able to use cmd+C to copy some selected text from a console, but I am not able to use cmd+V to paste text from the clipboard to a console? For this operation I am currently having to use the middle-mousebutton trick so that I can copy+paste between XQuartz and the OSX environment.

In my understand it should be possible to implement the paste operation by simply dumping what is currently in the clipboard to a kind of keyboard emulation and thus allow XQuartz to use cmd+V to paste text to whatever X11 application is currently open.

So why is this currently not already implemented and do I fail to see the technical reason for that?

There is no cmd-v because it's done automatically for you by the pasteboard proxy.

The middle mouse button is not a "trick" ... it's just how you paste from the PRIMARY selection in many X11 applications. Similarly, many other applications use ctrl-v or shift-insert or shift-ctrl-v to paste from the CLIPBOARD selection.

I am sorry if I have to follow-back on your reply here. I fully understand what you are saying and your reasonings behind it. However, I guess I have a certainly different use case which IMHO would make a cmd-v possibility very convenient. So please let me explain it so that you understand it in more detail:

The environment I am running here is XQuartz in a non-root (non-fullscreen) mode and I am using the 'dwm' window manager here to open a certain amount of urxvt terminals as well as certain X11 applications in almost full screen (without covering the OSX menu bar) in one OSX spaces desktop. The point in running XQuartz in non-root mode is that this allows me (together with dwm) to have X11 running in parallel to the standard OSX interface. So I can switch with e.g. Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. via the functionality of OSX Spaces between different OSX screens. Then on the dedicated window manager (dwm) OSX space I am able to use cmd+1, cmd+2, etc. to switch between the virtual desktops of dwm and have different urxvt terminals open on different virtual dwm desktops. In addition to that I have e.g. Safari open to browse the net and other bunch of OSX applications. Now if I want to copy&paste between OSX and my dwm environment I am currently doing the following operations:

1.  If I need to copy something \*from\* an urxvt terminal I am using the mouse to select the text and then I press cmd+c to copy it into the OSX clipboard. Then I can perfectly use cmd+v within e.g. Safari to paste that text.
2.  If I now need to copy something \*to\* an urxvt terminal (e.g. from Safari) I go to Safari, select the text, press cmd+c and then I switch to my dwm/urxvt osx space and then I am currently forced to hold the ALT key while pressing the middle mouse button. Only this operation inserts the content of the OSX clipboard to the urxvt console window because I have clipboard syncing enabled in the XQuartz settings.

So far this procedure works quite fine and I am able to copy&paste between OSX and my urxvt/dwm environment perfectly. However, if you closely read through the above procedure you will note that I am forced to use the mouse to paste into the urxvt terminal. Nevertheless IMHO it would be more convenient if XQuartz would directly allow me to use cmd+v to paste the current content of the clipboard directly without having to use the mouse at all.

As said above, I perfectly understand the specifications of the X11 clipboard and I am not saying the middle-mouse button functionality should be replaced. I am only arguing that there might be use cases (like mine) where simply pressing cmd+v within XQuartz would be very convenient. So my question is really if there is any technical reason why an added cmd+v functionality would not be possible within XQuartz? In my understanding this should be technically possible so that using cmd+v would simply paste the content to whatever is currently active (or by emulating ALT+middle mouse button?)

Yes, I understand the desire, but what should cmd-v \*DO\*? I understand that you want it to paste, but there is no way for the X11 server to instruct an X11 client to paste. The X11 server can tell the client that the user has made certain keystrokes or mouse movment, but there is no "paste" instruction. Additionally, different X11 applications over the years have adopted different commands for paste, including ctrl-v, ctrl-shift-v, shift-insert, middle-click, etc ... and different commands for different clipboards. It's simply not possible to send an instruction to the X11 server instructing it to tell the active application to paste. If this is something you really want, I suggest you bring it up on xorg-devel. Perhaps we could designate a keycode as paste (I believe there are keysyms for that for Sun Type 5 keyboards, so that may already be done), but of course every application you care about will then need to support that keysym.

I certainly understand that pasting operations are not so straight forward in an X11 environment and that unfortunately the X11 makers never defined an explicit clipboard paste key code which would make things quite easier. However, I still think that adding some cmd-v support (or kinda simulation) should be in principle still possible without having to introduce a specific X11 keysym. So IMHO there should be two different possibilities:

1.  You could add support to XQuartz to be able to configure how and what cmd-v should perform. In case of my use case (dwm+urxvt) I would configure (in the preferences of XQuartz) that a cmd-v press should initiate a ALT+middle-click to the currently active X11 window. That way urxvt will be triggered to perform the desired paste operation.

<!-- -->

1.  As, of course, such generic configuration of what cmd-v should do might be not so straight forward (one application requires ctrl-v, the other ctrl-shift-v, etc., thus cumbersome) there could be the other possibility to simply let XQuartz read the content of the OSX or X11 clipboard upon a cmd-v press and then plainly and proactively sending the content of the clipboard to the currently active X11 window. Thus, in the end this would more or less simulate keyboard input and thus would allow to paste whatever is currently stored in the clipboard to the currently active X11 window.

Of course, one would need to see which of the above solutions would make more sense, but IMHO one of those should be technically possible without interfering with any other functionality of XQuartz. So, does this make sense to you or do you see any technical reasons that would prevent these kind of solutions for my cmd-v request?

Those are all interesting ideas, and I'd certainly welcome you to make those changes, and we could integrate them into a future update if that is something you're interested in doing.

Actually, I would love to do that. However, I haven't tried to compile XQuartz myself and thus would need probably some help/assistence from you to not only get it compiled but also to show me at which areas of the code I might have to implement that functionality. So if it's fine with you I will first try to get all components checked out from your git repository and then compiled and if I run into trouble I would like to get in touch with you again so that you can show me how to fix it and where to perform my suggested changes, right? So please allow me to reopen this ticket.

Excellent.

First off, don't be shy about asking questions in the \#xquartz IRC channel (FreeNode) or the xquartz-dev mailing list as others will benefit or be able to help out.

Check out the [DeveloperInfo](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/DeveloperInfo) wiki.

I suggest you start with XQuartz 2.7.8\_beta1 (or later) since it has the 1.16.x server. There were build revlock issues with libXfont/fontsproto/xorg-server that were quite annoying to deal with. Older servers require the older libXfont/fontsproto. 1.16 and later servers require the newer libXfont/fontsproto.

With that installed, you just need to install a few build tools to help you out. You'll need to install pkg-config, autoconf, automake, and glibtool. I use MacPorts for that, but you can use fink, build them yourself, etc.

Get sources from my server-1.16-apple branch (note that it gets rebased on top of server-1.16-branch periodically)

    git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver
    cd xserver
    git checkout -f  server-1.16-apple

See [DeveloperInfo\#xserver](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/DeveloperInfo#xserver) for more info.
