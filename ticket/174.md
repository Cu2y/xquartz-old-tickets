Window close by MacOSX titlebar close button impossible or crashing xserver and application
===========================================================================================


Windows created by IDL (interactive data language) don't properly close by using the red close button of the MacOSX window title bar.

Two possibilities:

1.  Closing works but the xserver goes down and crashes the application by loss of connection.
2.  Closing does not work. Window can only be closed by programmed closing.

Seemingly this is related to how the xserver is started. Crash (1.) appears (often) if X11 is implicitly (?) started by the application (DISPLAY was not defined). Second version appears (often) if X11 is already running and the application ist started (DISPLAY was already defined).

-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.2*

Your report is a bit unclear.

You report 2 possibilities, the first of which is a crash. Well, that's easy to diagnose. Did the X server crash or not? If it did, then that's the problem. Report the crash report here.

DISPLAY should always be defined. It should just never be set by you. It should always be defined to "/tmp/launch-...".

The way in which the X server is started should not matter unless you have multiple copies of X11.app on your system.
