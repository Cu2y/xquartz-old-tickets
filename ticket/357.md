xnest and Xephyr fail in Xquartz 2.5.0\_RC1
===========================================


I tried xnest and Xephyr in RC1 and neither one works. They just have a blank, black screen.

Here's the input/output for XQuartz 2.5.0\_RC1:

    jernigans-powerbook-g4-114:~ jernigan$ xnest :3 -query hydra.gat.com -once
    (EE) AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so failed (dlopen(/usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so, 5): image not found)
    (EE) GLX: could not load software renderer
    (EE) XKB: Couldn't open rules file /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/rules/base
    (EE) XKB: No components provided for device Virtual core keyboard
    (EE) XKB: Couldn't open rules file /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg
    (EE) XKB: No components provided for device (unnamed keyboard)
    XDM: too many retransmissions
    jernigans-powerbook-g4-114:~ jernigan$ 

Here's the input/output for X11 from 10.6.2 which works:

    macterm127:~ jernigan$ xnest :3 -query hydra.gat.com -once
    (EE) AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so failed (dlopen(/usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so, 5): image not found)
    (EE) GLX: could not load software renderer
    (EE) XKB: Couldn't open rules file /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb/rules/base
    (EE) XKB: No components provided for device Virtual core keyboard
    Couldn't get keyboard.
    macterm127:~ jernigan$

You're running /usr/X11/bin/Xnest, not /opt/X11/bin/Xnest ...

Can you please try /opt/X11/bin/Xnest ?

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.5.1* to *2.5.0*

The xkb versions fail because they try reading the keymap from the system and have no idea what we have set it to. I'll need to roll back to an older server for Xnest and friends.

Upstream issue opened regarding the underlying problem:

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Rolled back to 1.6 branch and disabled xkb by default. This looks to be working here and should be correct with 2.5.0\_rc2 when released.

Try downloading these two binaries and copying them to /opt/X11/bin to replace the ones in 2.5.0
