no download icon on safari????
==============================


Looked into the file and it seems that download is misspelled as downloadd (two d's on system analysis). I am an imbecile about these things but it caused me a start as an English major.
Cannot find downloads unless I go into all my files which only has downloads....help. I do not understand the boxes underneath this window text box....sorry.

download icon seems to be a common problem. I think it is malicious and mean of whomever did this.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

I have no idea what this means.
