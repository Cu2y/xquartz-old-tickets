Cut and paste not working between X11 windows and other applications
====================================================================


Hi all,

I have a problem with an Intel Mac running OSX 10.5.7 and XQuartz 2.3.3.2 where cut and paste does not work between X11 and other apps. I have tried installing the dmg supplied here:

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/271>

... but it didn't solve the problem.

I would love for this to be fixed as I use mutt in xterm and constantly need to copy between emails and other applications.

I can supply further information if necessary.

Thanks,
Dan Tomlinson

-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.0*

Do you have it enabled in your preferences? If so, what part is failing? CLIPBOARD to NSPasteboard, PRIMARY to NSPasteboard, NSPasteboard to CLIPBOARD, or NSPasteboard to PRIMARY?

Hi there,

sorry I didn't realise this was now an option! The cut and paste "just worked" before. Anyway, after doing the following:

Under preferences -&gt; pasteboard:

Select Enable Syncing which in turn allows to select:

-   Update Pasteboard when CLIPBOARD changes
-   Update CLIPBOARD when Pasteboard changes
-   Update PRIMARY (middle-click) when Pasteboard changes

I didn't select the final option which is:

-   Update Pasteboard immediately when new text is selcted (Due to limitations in the X11 protocol, this option may not always work in some applications)

... everything seems to work as expected.

Thanks for the pointer and I think this bug can be closed. By the way - do you think it would be a good idea to turn this on by default in future?

Many thanks,
Dan

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

It actually is on by default. My guess is that you did the following:

Updated to 10.5.7
Ran X11
Went into X11's preferences
Updated XQuartz

I didn't realize this until after 10.5.7 shipped, but the old localizations in 10.5.7's X11 cause the new preferences to be disabled since there is no checkbox for them. I just thought that no checkbox would result in the defaults not changing. Sorry for that.
