Can't launch XQuartz
====================


Env. : OS X 10.9 (13A603) MacBook Pro 2,66 GHz Intel Core i7 8 Go

Hello there,

I installed XQuartz 2.7.5 (xorg-server 1.14.4) and doesn't launch at all from the /Applications/Utilities directory (nor it does from Spotlight). However, I can start it from a terminal running /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin. I tried the bash script in the same directory but that did not do anything (see below).
$ bash -x ./X11
++ dirname ./X11
+ set ./X11.bin
+ '-x /Users/emmanuel/.x11run'
+ case $(basename "${SHELL}") in
++ basename /bin/bash
+ exec -l /bin/bash --login -c 'exec "${@}"' - ./X11.bin

Finally, I thought I could do with just calling X11.bin but even though I can start 'xlogo' for instance, I fail to start Inkscape which seems to quit straight away.

What can I do to provide you with more info on that issue?

Best regards,

Emmanuel

What is output to syslog when you try?

I have been having this problem in OS X 10.9.2, trying to run Inkscape using XQuartz 2.7.5. XQuartz simply does not work. Here is what I get from syslog when trying to open Inkscape:

You've set DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH ... don't do that.

I have not set anything. I downloaded and installed on a brand new MacBook, and xquartz did not run. Can you be more specific? Is there a configuration file I need to modify?

Okay, so I do not remember setting DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, but removing Macports seemed to do the trick, in case anyone runs into this in the future.

MacPorts does not set DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH either. You likely have something in your ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, ~/.bash\_profile, or similar. Don't do that.

Note that removing MacPorts likely removed /opt/local/lib, so it was not resolved. That does not fix your problem. It just masks it even more.

Okay, thanks for your help.
