Running an SSH tunneled display to CentOS results in GLX failure
================================================================


I am trying to run an OpenGL application from my remote system which is running 64-bit CentOS 5.1+ (fully updated). When I start any GL application, I get the following error messages:

\[joey@porky ~\]$ glxgears
X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)

> Major opcode of failed request: 147 (GLX)
> Minor opcode of failed request: 5 (X\_GLXMakeCurrent)
> Serial number of failed request: 22
> Current serial number in output stream: 22

Even with indirect rendering:

\[joey@porky ~\]$ LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_INDIRECT=1 glxgears
X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)

> Major opcode of failed request: 147 (GLX)
> Minor opcode of failed request: 5 (X\_GLXMakeCurrent)
> Serial number of failed request: 21
> Current serial number in output stream: 21

I am using v6.5.1 of Mesa on the remote Linux system.

Please try updating mesa to 7.8.2 ... I don't have this problem with my remote ubuntu or gentoo machines running 7.8.2

An X11.bin containing this patch can be found here and installed with 2.5.2:

<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/X11.bin-PR-423.bz2>

2.6.0\_alpha1 should work as well when it is released.

Hi Jeremy et al,

> Thanks for attending to this: this issue plagues me as well. I run leopard on both PPC and intels -

The binary patch above won't go for me on PPC, I'm guessing I have to wait a bit to get one
that works for me? Remote openGL to all my linux machines (some pretty up to date) doesn't function.
Many thanks,

> James Gunning.
