Button 2 position is reported wrong after fast user switching
=============================================================


Seen on a system running MacOS X 10.5.8. XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.7.6). Mouse is a Logitech bluetooth mouse with a middle scroll button that is reported as button 2 when pressed, and buttons 4 and 5 when scrolled in the two different directions.

1.  Login as user A
2.  Start an xterm
3.  Use fast user switching to log in as user B
4.  Start an xterm as user B

Running "xinput test pointer" shows that the position of button 2 is reported incorrectly when clicked, while the positions of buttons 1 and 3 are still reported correctly when clicked. xev shows that clicking button B outside of the black boundary will be reported as a LeaveNotify event or no event at all.

    button release 1 a[0]=666 a[1]=187

Sorry "xev shows that clicking button B" should read "xev shows that clicking button 2"

Replying to [mthorn@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/389#comment:1):

I mentioned this too in an email I sent to the mailing list in December (<http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/xquartz-dev/2009-December/002705.html>), but never got around to adding a bug report. I am getting this problem with snow leopard.

Only the middle click is affected, not the left and right clicks. As far as I can tell, the deltaXY values for middle clicks become erroneous during fast user switching. I get around this problem when compiling the macports server by adding an exception for middle clicks in X11Application.m, as was done for tablets. Please see the attached file xorg-server-middle\_click.patch.

Since I use the macports X11 servers with this patch, I don't know if the latest operating system update has fixed this problem yet.

I tested this on quake2 (which was an obvious example that required the other code path), and it seems fine.
