figure out the dix-config.h in darwin.h crash
=============================================


This needs to be addressed as it is indicative of inconsistent \#defines between out source files which might be leading to inconsistent data structure definitions between them (and therefore causing other crashes)

All source files in the 1.2 branch now include xorg-config.h. I'll do similar updates to 1.4 to all include dix-config.h. This brough to light one weird bug. Defineing NDEBUG while including assert.h caused us to hang... not sure why...
