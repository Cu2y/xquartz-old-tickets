modifier keys should not repeat
===============================


A change between 1.4.2-apple30 and 1.4.2-apple31 is causing an odd behaviour in urxvt. After activating the iso14755 mode (by pressing and keeping pressed ctrl-shift) and left-clicking on a cell, the created overlay instantly disappears and the default one created on ctrl-shift press is back. Debugging a bit I found that the urxvt callback for the window is called continuously with the same Xevent after pressing ctrl-shift, which is causing the overlay to be immediately reset.

Do you know which change is causing your problem?

No, and I do not have the time to find it by compiling xquartz myself. You cannot reproduce it?

I am not certain what the expected behavior is, since I don't use this functionality in rxvt. When I press ctrl-shift in rxvt, I get "Keycap picture insert mode" ... but I don't know what that is for.

Modifier key presses and releases have been updated to be much more correct, so it's possible that the behavior you were experiencing in the past was actually incorrect behavior and the current behavior is correct behavior.

It is definitely not correct behaviour. Note that you should get "Keycap picture insert mode" only if you release ctrl-shift, while to reproduce the bug you have to keep them pressed and left-click on a cell.

-   **Summary** changed from *odd behaviour with key press events* to *modifier keys should not repeat*

Hmm... It looks like an issue with key-repeat. We should disable repeating on the modifier keys. As a workaround for now, create a ~/.xinitrc.d/no-repeat.sh file (chmod 755 it) with the following:

    xset -r 63
    xset -r 64
    xset -r 66
    xset -r 67
    xset -r 68
    xset -r 69
    xset -r 71

This is fixed in 2.3.3\_rc2 using xset, but I want to find a way to do this in the server itself
