First, if this can help, those tooltips are the same which ticket [\#⁠8](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/8) was concerned about. It's nice that this very annoying bug got squashed but I am afraid that it has been hammered a bit too heavily!

As for being descript, the pointer hovers over some word, the X11 program WingIDE displays some info as a tooltip. Such a tooltip should be displayed in a simple rectangle with a grey background and a hairline rim. Instead, with the new 2.3.2 rc1, it is displayed in a first-class window of its own with a title bar. The image illustrates that: the window title bar should not be there. Only what is the window content on that image should be drawn.

Can you add a screenshot of the problem? The screenshot you added does not show this problem.

To be certain, you are using this on Leopard, correct?

can you please run 'xwininfo -all' and select that window.

I see override-redirect windows (menus and tooltips) being drawn correctly in xamacs, nedit, etc...

Do you have a binary package of this IDE that I can install, or do I need to install it from macports?

Tooltips in gimp are being drawn correctly...

There is obviously a misunderstanding about it. Do you see all that Python code syntactically-highlighted? That's the normal window on the top of which the tooltip appears. And the tooltip is that little window named wing.py. And the tooltip text is 'aspirin\_1/scan…'

WingIDE

You can find binary installers here: <http://www.wingware.com/downloads>
I am using the WingIDE Pro version 3.1.5
A side note: I had that problem with the tooltip that the debugger shows. So you need to get some Python code, put a breakpoint somewhere, by clicking in the leftmost column next to the editor window, and debug. When the debugger stops there, just hover over a variable in your Python script.
Another side note: I have found out that the GUI tooltip, explaining what this or that button does I mean, do display fine.

All I see when I click on your "screenshot" is an image of a string "tooltips.tiff". I don't see any python code.

Please email me your screenshot if you're having trouble attaching it here.

It is clear from the xwininfo that this is not an override-redirect window... so quartz-wm is managing it and would place a frame on it if the app doesn't request no frame...

Can you verify that this worked with 2.3.1 and the same version of WingIDE?

This is a bug in WingIDE. It is setting the window type to \_NET\_WM\_WINDOW\_TYPE\_NORMAL.

You can verify this with this application (compile it and pass the window id as an argument):

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <X11/Xlib.h>

    Display *x_dpy;

    int
    x_get_property (Window id, Atom atom, long *dest,
                    unsigned int dest_size, unsigned int min_items)
    {
        Atom type;
        int format;
        unsigned int i;
        unsigned long nitems;
        unsigned char *data = 0;
        int ret = 0;

        do {
            long long_length = 32;
            unsigned long bytes_after;
            while (1)
            {
                if (data != NULL)
                    XFree (data);

                if (XGetWindowProperty (x_dpy, id, atom, 0, long_length, 0,
                                        AnyPropertyType, &type, &format,
                                        &nitems, &bytes_after, &data) != Success)
                    return 0;
                if (type == None)
                    return 0;
                if (bytes_after == 0)
                    break;
                long_length += (bytes_after / sizeof(unsigned long)) + 1;
            }
        } while (0);

        if (format == 32 && nitems >= min_items)
        {
            for (i = 0; i < ((nitems < dest_size) ? nitems : dest_size); i++)
                dest[i] = ((unsigned long *) data)[i];
            ret = i;
        }

        XFree (data);

        return ret;
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int id = atoi(argv[1]);
        int n, i;
        long atoms[16];
        Atom net_wm_window_type;

        x_dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        net_wm_window_type = XInternAtom (x_dpy, "_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE", 0);

        n = x_get_property(id, net_wm_window_type, atoms, 16, 0);

        if(n == 0) {
            printf("None\n");
        } else {
            for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
                char *name = XGetAtomName(x_dpy, atoms[i]);
                printf("%s\n", name);
                XFree(name);
            }
        }

        exit(0);    
    }

The popup is a \_NET\_WM\_WINDOW\_TYPE\_NORMAL window that's configured to have no decoration by setting the \_XA\_MOTIF\_WM\_HINTS window property to 0. I realize that it's up to the window manager to decide what to do here, but other window managers and older versions of Apple X11 did honor the request.

The net\_wm types override any motif hints in quartz-wm.

Can you \*PLEASE\* verify that this bug was not present in 2.3.1? Or can you tell me the last time this did work for you? I can't see any way that this bug would be new in 2.3.2\_rc1. Further, it looks to me like this behavior should be seen in any version of quartz-wm that shipped with Leopard or Tiger.

What "older versions of Apple X11" honored this request?

I have been using WingIDE on MacOS for years and I have never ever seen the reported problem until I installed 2.3.2 rc1. Just to rule out any strange fluke, I have wiped out /usr/X11 and X11.app an reinstalled the 2.3.1 package: the debugger tooltips are then displayed without a title bar. Just in case it matters, I run MacOS 10.5.5 on a MacPro first generation with a NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT.

Ok, this will be fixed in 2.3.2\_rc2.
