This was working with the default X11 install of Mac OS 10.5.3; the problem arise with updating to XQuartz 2.2.3.

Hello,

That one didn't work either but I just noticed it does give line numbers with errors:

Ok, I updated it to fix that additional problem. Can you give this update a go and let me know how it works for you?

Thanks.

Actually... that's not going to work either... I don't think there's going to be a way to really fix this given the limitations of bash... hmm...

Hehe, ok just let me know when you're ready for me to try it out. Thanks.

Ok. try this... but I don't know if this is compatible with other shells, but it should work ok with bash on OSX.

And this one should work with all shells... can you give it a try?
