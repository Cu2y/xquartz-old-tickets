Windows refuse to accept input
==============================


If in preferences I have "Enable key equivalents under X11" unchecked, and I use Command-backtick to switch active windows, X11 windows will stop accepting input from both mouse and keyboard. Minimizing the windows and restoring them will unblock the input.

This is essentially an intentional duplicate of [Ticket 169](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/169). I posted a message there indicating that the bug still exists, but since the ticket was already closed, I guess nobody paid any attention to it. I've just installed the 2.5.0 release, and the bug still exists.
