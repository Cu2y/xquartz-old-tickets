-   **Description** modified

What version of the server? Did you do anything "else" to your system?

The shipping version of libsasl2.dylib has compat version 3.0.0 on SnowLeopard... which makes me think you've replaced /usr/lib/libsasl2.dylib on your system with a bad version.

    ~ $  otool -L /usr/lib/libsasl2.2.dylib

Well your crash log says:

    Reason: Incompatible library version: PasswordServer requires version 3.0.0 or later, but libsasl2.2.dylib provides version 0.0.0

so... something is amiss. Are you playing with environment variables? Run this:

    set | grep PATH

DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH are your problem. You're forcing the loader to choose a different lib than the one Apple ships in /usr/lib

After execute the "sudo port deactivate cyrus-sasl2 libgsasl giflib jpeg tiff png libpng mesa", then X11 could run normally.

Yes... if you remove libjpeg, and ddd uses libjpeg, ddd will cease to work... that is expected.

As mentioned, the problem is that you are setting DYDL\_LIBRARY\_PATH without understanding how it works. Stop setting that environment variable and things will behave correctly.

And don't run /opt/local/bin/X to start the server, just run your application and let launchd start the server, or just run the .app (/Applications/MacPorts/X11.app)

Run the /Applications/MacPorts/X11.app will crash too.
And as run DDD, it will hang with following error message.

It seems that the「cyrus-sasl2 libgsasl giflib jpeg tiff png libpng mesa」mac ports does not support X11 now.

No, the problem is your environment variables. Don't set those environment variables which you do not understand. They are causing all your problems.

Do yuo mean thah I should not use applications or libraries from macports ? If I have no set these environment variables for macport , I could not use anything from macports.

I follow your suggestion but it still cannot startup the x11.app from macports, without error message is appear.

This is not the correct location to discuss this issue. Please bring this up on the macports-users mailing list.

And no, I do not mean you shouldn't use MacPorts. What I said explicitly was you should not set these environment variables:

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Your setting those is the root of all your problems.

I remark all of the DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variables but the X11 from macports still could not to startup normally.
ddd is still hanging with such "Class: XmPushButton/Illegal mnemonic character; Could not convert X KEYSYM to a keycode" error message and it could not run normally.
Thanks for you help~

Yes, I understand. Those messages pertain to motif and are not produced by anything shipped by XQuartz. Please take this discussion to an appropriate forum (like the macports-users mailing list).
