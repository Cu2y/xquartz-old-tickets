Culdn't run any X application under XQuartz(hang?)
==================================================


Probably I'm doing something wrong since I newbi. I have got MacBookPro with Mac OS 10.5.4 with attached "Apple Cinema HD Display" I then isntalled X11 and X11 SDK from provided mac installation DVD and then installed XQuartz 2.3.0.

What I have got now it's when I run /Application/Utilities/X11 it's hangs the same happens if I'm trying to run any X application(e.g. xclock) from /usr/X11/bin I mean I see it in the "Activity Monitor" but nothing come up on my screen.

But when I run /usr/X11/bin/XQuartz it's up fine and X11 is up too but when I'm trying to run any X application nothing come up on my screen but I can see the process is run in "Activity Monitor". Here is Sample from xclock:
Sampling process 2615 for 3 seconds with 1 millisecond of run time between samples
Sampling completed, processing symbols...
Analysis of sampling xclock (pid 2615) every 1 millisecond
Call graph:

Total number in stack (recursive counted multiple, when &gt;=5):

Sort by top of stack, same collapsed (when &gt;= 5):

> poll$UNIX2003 2407

Sample analysis of process 2615 written to file /dev/stdout

My DISPLAY environment variable looks fine:

> echo $DISPLAY

/tmp/launch-k3lj5M/:0

Could somebody help me please?

Thanks, Maria

-   **Version** set to *2.3.0 (xserver-1.4)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.1*

You'll probably get a better response time and more eyes if you ask for help on the mailing list.

X11.app seems to be behaving correctly. It's waiting for Xquartz to tell it how to start. The problem seems to be with the LaunchAgent not running startx (or that not eventually running Xquartz).

Can you please copy the relevant sections from your system log (you can see it in console.app or via /var/log/system.log)

Did you logout after installing 2.3.0?
