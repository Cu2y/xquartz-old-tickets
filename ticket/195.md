Tooltip appears for inactive X Window even when behind active regular window
============================================================================


When hovering the mouse over a part of a (normal, non-X) window that has an X-window behind it, the tooltip from the X window appears. An image demonstrating the effect is attached: I do not have focus-follow-mouse on or anything like that. Only the Safari tooltip should be showing, but instead the X-window located underneath Safari is also showing its tooltip.
