X11 windows get shifted far offscreen after external monitor disconnected and reconnected
=========================================================================================


Summary:
If I have an X11 window on my second monitor (which is "arranged" above my laptop screen), then I disconnect the second monitor, then later reconnect the second monitor, the X11 window gets "moved" somewhere far offscreen into a place where I can't get it. I can see it if I "zoom out" with exposé; I can move it to different screens in that view, but I can't find a way to move it onto the visible portion of any screen. (Xquartz developers seem to think the problem is in OSX, not in their codebase.)

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Ensure that "Displays have separate spaces" is checked in the Mission Control control panel (MacOS 10.9)
2.  Connect external monitor to MacBook; "arranging" above is my setup
3.  Open an X11 window and drag onto external monitor
4.  Disconnect external monitor
5.  Reconnect external monitor

Expected Results:
X11 window would reappear somewhere close to its original location on the external monitor.

Actual Results:
X11 window is positioned so that none of it is visible or grab-able on any display.

I can second the observations described in this ticket. Is there any way to convey this to the OSX Engineering team?

I'm not sure what you mean by "the OSX Engineering team" ... this is a bug in Open Source Software, and there isn't really anybody actively maintaining it. I was the last one really working on it, up until about 3 years ago, but there's really nobody actively working on XQuartz.

Sorry, the discussion in ticket 796 led me to believe it was an OSX bug, not something that could be fixed in the open source software.

It's a combination of both. A change in the OS behavior triggered things to start behaving differently in XQuartz, but XQuartz will need to adapt to those changes.
