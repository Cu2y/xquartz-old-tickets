Application crash when opening a new Xterm
==========================================


This crash has already happened a few times, enough to report it. This didn't happened with previous versions.

The only noticeable activity, before the crash was a change in network configration (from home to office).

The crash happens when I open a new Xterm with Command-N keystrokes. No other windows was open at the time.

I've captured the crashreported logs and the syslog trace.
