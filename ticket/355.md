System X11 binaries ahead of XQuartz binaries in PATH
=====================================================


After installing XQuartz, on SL, the binaries from /opt/X11 are behind those in /usr/X11 and therefore won't be used by default.

I imagine that this is due to path\_helper reading the files in /etc/paths.d in alphabetical order, as renaming /etc/paths.d/XQuartz to 00XQuartz, for example, results in the XQuartz binaries ahead of the system X11 binaries in the path.

Should XQuartz be renamed so that path\_helper adds it to the PATH ahead of the system X11?

A further data point: using 2.5.0\_rc1 on 10.6.2, with this in ~/.bash\_profile:

PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/Library/Tcl/bin

If I launch a Terminal session and echo $PATH I get

/Users/tgl/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/Tcl/bin

But when I launch XQuartz (which I customarily do by clicking its Dock icon) and start an xterm, echo $PATH gives

/Users/tgl/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/Tcl/bin:/opt/X11/bin

So there is some additional round of append-/opt/X11/bin happening within the XQuartz environment. (I would not be happy if that were changed to a prepend action; I want my personal bin directory in front thank you very much.) It doesn't look to me like either addition of /opt/X11/bin is following a sorting rule; wouldn't /opt come before /usr if that happened?

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

I have this fixed locally and it will land in 2.5.0\_rc2
