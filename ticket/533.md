luit is a part of xquartz.
And this bug is never happen under other OS such as linux.

We ship it, yes. But there is nothing OS X specific, and it's not really critical to XQuartz.

If it no longer works, we can just remove it in the next release.

(noting this here, to reduce user confusion about the ultimate cause of the problem and its lack of resolution here).

Some followup was done here:

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45161>

The changes relevant to this bug are OS X specific (breakage in pty's relative to a given release).
The configure script changes address this.
