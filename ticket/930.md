Newest Xquartz (mavericks) homepage link broken
===============================================


I am trying to download the newest version of xQuartz and it seems that the link is broken. It tries to load the page for quite a while with no success. If I am doing something wrong could you guys e-mail me? <jgm7413@gmail.com> -Jacob

Thank you

[\#⁠924](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/924), server maintenance yesterday caused the outage. It should be resolved this evening (in about 9 hours).
