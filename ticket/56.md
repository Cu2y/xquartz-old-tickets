Double X11 Icon in dock following launch of v2.1.3
==================================================


When X windows is launched by double clicking the X11 Icon in /Applications, two X11 icons are created in the dock. Both have to be 'quit' (from the dock) to actually quit X11.

A further small bug is that if X11 is launched from the dock the Icon does not 'bounce' as is normally the case. However the application nevertheless launches, but with a second X11 Icon being also installed in the dock.

I should add this is on Mac Pro running Mac OS X 10.5.1

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.1.2 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.1.4*

Alan, this should not be the case in 2.1.3 which makes me think you have an old X11.app floating around. Please run this with X11 running:

ps ax | grep X11

Thanks for your prompt reply.

The results are as follows:

Macintosh:~ alanfry$ ps -ax | grep X11
393 ?? 0:00.02 /usr/bin/login -fp alanfry /bin/sh -c /usr/X11/bin/startx
394 ?? 0:00.01 /bin/bash --login /usr/X11/bin/startx
422 ?? 0:00.01 xinit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- :0 -auth /Users/alanfry/.serverauth.394
423 ?? 0:01.43 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 :0 -auth /Users/alanfry/.serverauth.394
427 ?? 0:00.01 /bin/sh /usr/X11/bin/startx
445 ?? 0:00.01 xinit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- :1 -auth /Users/alanfry/.serverauth.427
446 ?? 0:01.28 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 :1 -auth /Users/alanfry/.serverauth.427
505 ttys000 0:00.00 grep X11

FWIW both '.serverauth' files have a modification date of 'today 10:12' which is about when I launched X11, and there is only one X11.app showing up in /Applications/Utilities.

HTH,

Alan

Do you see something like this in Console.app?

    2/3/08 12:10:06 AM org.x.X11[2099] AUDIT: Sun Feb  3 00:10:06 2008: 2117 X11: client 1 rejected from local host (uid 4957)

    2/3/08 12:10:06 AM [0x0-0xec0ec].org.x.X11[2098] X11.app: Could not connect to server.  Starting X server.

Someone else is also reporting something similar on x11-users

Also, does this always happen? Does logging out then back in fix it? What do you need to do to get the system into this state?

Almost identical Console log:

03/02/2008 10:12:25 org.x.X11\[394\] AUDIT: Sun Feb 3 10:12:25 2008: 423 X11: client 1 rejected from local host (uid 501)

03/02/2008 10:12:25 \[0x0-0x2c02c\].org.x.X11\[393\] Xlib: No protocol specified
03/02/2008 10:12:25 \[0x0-0x2c02c\].org.x.X11\[393\] X11.app: Could not connect to server. Starting X server.

I could send the whole sequence, but it is quite long -- would that help?

Yes, it does always happen and neither logging out nor rebooting fixes it. For instance the following sequence occurs:

a) remove X11 alias from dock
b) reboot machine
c) double click /Applications/Utilities/X11.app
d) two X11 Icons appear in dock
e) cmd-Q one X11 Icon disappears
f) cmd-Q second X11 Icon disappears

This sequence can be repeated ad infinitum

-   **Version** changed from *2.1.2 (xserver-1.3)* to *2.1.3 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Priority** changed from *minor* to *critical*

On a fresh reboot, can you open up Terminal.app and do:

echo $DISPLAY
ls -l $DISPLAY
ls -l /tmp/.X\*
xdpyinfo

Stupid wiki formatting...

    echo $DISPLAY
    ls -l $DISPLAY
    ls -l /tmp/.X*
    xdpyinfo

Immediately after reboot:

    Macintosh:~ alanfry$ echo $DISPLAY
    :0.0
    Macintosh:~ alanfry$ ls -l $DISPLAY
    ls: :0.0: No such file or directory
    Macintosh:~ alanfry$ ls -l /tmp/.X*

You are setting $DISPLAY to something invalid in your environment. Don't set that environment variable. Look here for help finding where you are setting $DISPLAY: <http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ#sshXforwardingdebugging>

Ah -- it's a Mac Ports problem. There were two lines in .profile:

    export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
    export DISPLAY=:0.0

All this MacPorts stuff is left over from a failed attempt to install ghostview, which is the subject of a ticket to MacPorts. I have zapped the entire /opt directory and removed the two lines above and X11.app is now behaving normally.

In fact merely removing the line 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' fixed the X11 problem. So you were dead right with your diagnosis.

I have two uses at the moment for X11, ghostscript/ghostview and Gimp. Both seem to be functioning properly now.

Many thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Alan Ftry
