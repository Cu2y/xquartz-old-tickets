Unable to gain focus on a window under Mountain Lion
====================================================


This problem is one that was around many versions ago but has not been an issue until my upgrade to Mountain Lion. I am running 2.7.2 which I was prior to the update but I reinstalled after the upgrade to ML.

When I have multiple xterms open in different spaces, clicking on one of them will often shoot me back to another space and focus on a different window.

I can normally duplicate this by opening multiple xterms in one space and doing the same in another space. Going back to the original space if I try and click anywhere on the xterm that is in the background it will shoot me back to the other space and highlight or grab one of the other windows.

There is often no good way to get around this other than using Expose to select that window that wasn't in the foreground. I've tried using all combinations of focus-follows-mouse and click-through to try and see if the behavior changes but it does not.

Please try with XQuartz 2.7.3\_rc1 once it is out. This issue should be resolved.

-   **Resolution** *fixed* deleted

Reopening as this has been reported to not be fixed with 2.7.3\_rc1, so it's not the same root cause as the menubar bug.

Points of info:

-   Does not occur with 2.7.3\_rc1 on Snow Leopard
-   Does occur with 2.7.3\_rc1 on Mountain Lion

This means that the hittable / space switch code within XQuartz should be doing the right thing and makes me suspect that XQuartz is just not getting its space-chage notification.

I pushed that in r96233 for easy testing. Can someone please confirm that it works?

Whoops, wrong ticket. Please ignore the previous comment.

Please test this:

    curl -LO http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/libXplugin.1.dylib-PR-610
    sudo cp /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib.bak
    sudo cp libXplugin.1.dylib-PR-610 /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib
    sudo chmod 755 /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib

I've tested PR-610 with the same results.

In one space I open two xterms and offset them a bit so I can see both title bars. Then move to another space and open two xterms. Go back to the first space and try and click on the one in the background of two and whammo, you are changed back to the second space.

I notice often that in that test when I revisit space one, the foreground xterm lights up like it is active, but when I hover over the one in the background it does not get focus. And when I try and click on it is when it takes back to the other space.

At that point it starts doing all kinds of odd things regarding which window gets focus, which one takes me back to another space and which one eventually can get focus and work correctly.

Did you quit and restart XQuartz?

Ah hmm... it is still there... weird... well that dylib fixes one part of a chain... hrm...

Yes I had restarted. I'm gathering by the second comment you were able to reproduce it still. Thanks for looking into it.

I just want to confirm all of what has been said above. I see the same bug on multiple machines that have been updated to Mountain Lion.

I'm looking forward to a fix!
