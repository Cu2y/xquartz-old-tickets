2.4.0 Causes X11.app Crash When Quitting My (Remote) Apps
=========================================================


I have an OpenSUSE 10.2 VMware Fusion 2.0.5 VM, and I connect to it via X11.app using the Terminal.app command:
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -ls -geometry 132x40 -fn "lucidasans10" -e ssh - X -Y email@hidden "kicker&"&

This allows me to use the full real estate of my 30" display for my Linux apps (without needing to run X11 fullscreen), and also allows my OpenGL code to run with hardware acceleration (VMware Fusion doesn't support hardware-accelerated OpenGL). The VM is running on the same machine as X11.app. My system is an Early 2009 Dual 2.93GHz Quad-Core "Nehalem" Mac Pro with 12GB RAM and Apple's ATI Radeon HD 4870 graphics card, running Mac OS X 10.5.8 with all current Apple Sofware Updates installed.

My Linux apps are written in C++ using Qt 3.5, KDE, and OpenGL via kdevelop. Prior to installing X11 2.4.0, this worked VERY well (and had for well over a year).

Now with X11 2.4.0, EVERY time I quit one of my Qt/KDE/OpenGL apps, X11.app crashes! This is obviously not acceptable.

The crash log (truncated) is:

I can provide the full crash log if needed, of course.

I got some time this evening to do a little testing.

I reinstalled to the 2009-08-14 "X11-2.4.0 (with Xquartz-1.5.3-apple14 for 10.5.8+)" on my Mac Pro running 10.5.8, as I had reverted to the 2009-05-17 "X11-2.3.3.2 (with Xquartz-1.4.2-apple42 for 10.5.7+)" after I had the crashing issue recently. I then confirmed that I still get the X11.app crash when I connect to my OpenSUSE 10.1 VMware 2.0.5 VM via X11 (using: /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -ls -geometry 132x40 -fn "lucidasans10" -e ssh -X -Y daryl@192.168.0.17 "kicker&"&), then run and quit my KDE3+Qt3+OpenGL apps.

I then followed your directions to replace the "Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin" with the 2009-08-05 "X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47" version. With this older X11.bin, the crash is gone, so the problem does seem to have started between the 2009-08-05 "X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47" and the 2009-08-14 "X11.bin-1.5.3-apple14".

I hope to have more time to work on this tomorrow. Which X11.bin should I try next? I assume that since X11.bin-1.4.2-apple47 is okay, there's no need to try X11.bin-1.4.2-apple46, and the next version at &lt;<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/>&gt; in X11.bin-1.5.3-apple14, which appears to be the default version from 2.4.0 that was causing my crashes... So just let me know what to try next.

I'll also try and get time to create a simple example of an app to reproduce this crash (which may be tricky given how complex these apps are, as the are KDE3 KParts using Qt3 GUIs with OpenGL views, and use PLIB/SSG, freetype, etc.), but I'm not sure how useful that would be unless you also set up a Linux system like I have and ssh in as I do... Still, it may just require a simple OpenGL app (as Kate and other non-OpenGL KDE/Qt apps don't appear to trigger the crash of the Mac's X11.app), so I'll try this and see what I can get to you. I probably won't have time to do so until this weekend, though.

Correction: its an OpenSUSE 10.2 (not 10.1) VM.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/303#comment:4):

> I've had reports that this is fixed with 2.5.0\_rc1. Please test 2.5.0\_rc1.

I've since upgraded my Linux development system to a real PC running OpenSUSE 11.1 (mainly due to a need for OpenGL hardware acceleration), but I don't think that makes a difference.

I just installed 2.5.0\_rc1 and is does appear to fix this crash! Thanks!
