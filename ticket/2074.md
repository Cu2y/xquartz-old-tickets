catastrophic slowdown in tk widget drawing in XQuartz 2.7.7 on Mac OS X 10.10.1
===============================================================================


The drawing speed of simple tk widgets has slowed down by a factor of
up to 1000x in Mac OS X 10.10.1 running XQuartz 2.7.7.

An X11 program (for cortical surface reconstruction) that uses tcl/tk to
display widgets was freshly compiled (including a default compile of
tcl/tk 8.5.12) on a fresh factory install of Mac OS X 10.10.1 on a Mac Pro
against the X11 libraries in XQuartz 2.7.7.

Widget drawing that previously took 50 milliseconds to complete on 2011
MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.8 now takes almost 20 seconds.

OpenGL performance in a GLX window is satisfactory.

The same source code compiled on 10.6.8 behaved the same as
the 10.10.1 compile on 10.10.1.

As a simple example of this behavior, the following tk code:

    for {set j 0} {$j < 20} {incr j} {
      frame .f$j
      pack .f$j -side top
      for {set i 0} {$i < 20} {incr i} {
        button .f$j.b$i -text asdf
        pack .f$j.b$i -side left
        #update idletasks
      }
    }

takes 10 msec to complete in Mac OS X 10.6 running XQuartz 2.7.7
but almost 10 sec to complete on 10.10.1 running XQuartz 2.7.7.
(for comparison, the same code takes 60 msec to complete in
the Mac native tk 8.5.9 included with Mac OS X 10.10.1).

The slowdown is not affected by ticking "Prevent App Nap" in
the X11.app Info panel.

The slowdown is present in both Full Screen Mode and non-Full
Screen mode.

Moving the xwindow around during the 10 sec while the widgets
are being drawn has no effect on the delay.

CPU usage from 'top' during the 10 sec draw time is low
(1%). Commenting in "update idletasks" shows each button
as it is (very slowly) drawn.

I am happy to run any diagnostics to provide more useful
information.

cheers,
marty sereno

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *OSX*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

File a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> for regressions caused by the host OS.

I will attempt a more detailed analysis to avoid an "Invalid" resolution

The reason it was closed as invalid is because there's nothing that can be done on our end to address a performance regression caused by a change in the OS. You need to file this report with Apple and not with XQuartz.

Thanks for the explanation. I will file it with Apple.
