Focusing X11 doesn't bring the X11 client window to top
=======================================================


I need to switch to X11 twice to make the windows inside pop up.

ie. apple-tab to x11 and then apple-tab to x11 again without selecting another application. or click on the dock item more than once.

once to focus X11 and once more to bring the windows to the top.

using X11-1.4.2-apple22

Are you using the new checkbox in spaces preferences for "Don't automatically switch to a space with windows in it?"

Im not using spaces at all. But "when switching to an application...." was unchecked.

Checked it disabled spaces again and everything works normally now.

Thanks for the info.

I have a similar problem running Matlab with X11 (2.3.3.2) under Leopard OSX 10.5.7. The minimize button gets disabled after switching between non-X11 windows. Finally, the workspace window of Matlab get stuck in the ALWAYS ON TOP state.

Thanks for all your hard work.

I don't see why this is a dup of [\#⁠98](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/98) as that one is connected to spaces and this one is independent of spaces? I see the above behavior, having to select X11 twice when Command-tabbing or clicking the dock icon to it to get it to raise the windows, all the time. No other application works like this. I'm using the latest release XQuartz 2.3.3.2 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple42) and have spaces off.

It has nothing to do with spaces being on or of (multiple spaces). It has to do with the checkbox in the Spaces preference which controls the behavior in question regardless of how many spaces you have.

I'm still confused. What checkbox in Spaces preferences I can changes to make switching to X11 work right (keeping in mind that I don't use spaces at all)?

In system preferences, the checkbox at the bottom that says "when switching an application, ..." make sure it is "on" ... you may need to briefly turn spaces on, flip that checkbox, then turn spaces back off (yes, confusing... that is why it is a bug).

OK. I got it to work after a few tries.

Thanks much!
