Documentation bug in the installer
==================================


I attempt to install XQuartz. The installer presents this text:

"If this is your first time installing XQuartz, you may wish to logout and log back in."

It fails to specify whether you should do so before or after installing. (I don't think it's possible to pause, and do it during the installation, but I could be wrong.) It also doesn't say what you're supposed to log out of and back into, but I presume it means the OS. I think most users do this by rebooting; it doesn't specify whether that's necessary.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *wontfix*

Why would you do it before installing? That makes no sense.

As for "what" ... that would be your account.

Rebooting is not necessary.
