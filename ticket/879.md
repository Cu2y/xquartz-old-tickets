Xquartz tries to restart using display :1
=========================================


The first time I start Xquartz, it works just fine. Then when I close it and restart, it tries to start X on display :1 it fails and continuously tries to respawn until I reboot. Here is part of the successful log:

X11.app: do\_start\_x11\_server(): argc=6

> argv\[0\] = /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz
> argv\[1\] = :0
> argv\[2\] = -nolisten
> argv\[3\] = tcp
> argv\[4\] = -auth
> argv\[5\] = /Users/chris2/.serverauth.258

Here is the unsuccessful log:

X11.app: do\_start\_x11\_server(): argc=6

> argv\[0\] = /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz
> argv\[1\] = :1
> argv\[2\] = -nolisten
> argv\[3\] = tcp
> argv\[4\] = -auth
> argv\[5\] = /Users/chris2/.serverauth.710

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *behaves correctly*

Yes, if :0 is locked (already used, uncleaned after termination, etc), :1 is used.

The fact that it uses :1 in this case is correct.

The fact that it didn't clean up :0 on termination last time is a bug (that already has a ticket).
