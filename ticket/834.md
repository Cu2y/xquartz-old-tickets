Connection refused to display
=============================


On a MacBook Pro with retina display running Mavericks, if I start XQuartz the first time after reboot, run "xhost +" in a terminal, rlogin to a linux machine, set the DISPLAY variable properly, and run e.g. xterm on the remote machine, the xterm window comes up correctly. Then, if I quit XQuartz, relaunch it, and repeat the same operation I get a "Cannot connect to display" message from the linux machine. The only way to have XQuartz working again is to reboot the MacBook.

Use ssh instead. You don't need to reboot your mac, you just need to set the DISPLAY variable properly (you're not setting it right on subsequent launches).

I am setting the DISPLAY the second time exactly the same way as I am setting it the first time. The first time it works fine while the second time it does not.

It is true that I can use ssh, however, the behavior is still abnormal. Xquartz should behave the same way the first time it is used after reboot and the subsequent times.

Please give a look to it...

Thank you.

Exactly. So the second time you set it, it is wrong. You are assuming it is :0 which is not something you can rely on.

> It is true that I can use ssh, however, the behavior is still abnormal. Xquartz should behave the same way the first time it is used after reboot and the subsequent times.

The issue here is that the socket lockfile isn't being cleaned up on exit for some reason, so xinit uses :1 on the next launch, then :2, then :3, etc.

I have. This is a known issue that was discovered after 2.7.5 was released. Just set DISPLAY properly, and you'll be fine. Hopefully a fix for the underlying issue will be in 2.7.6
