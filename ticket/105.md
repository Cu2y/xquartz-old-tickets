override-redirect windows (xemacs and nedit menus) are redrawn in their original space
======================================================================================


> We have a set of xview based programs. Using F8 and drag it is now possible to move an xview window from space x to space y. The problem is that once you activate a menu (in a pinnable window) selection on a given instance of an application in a given Space then all menu items for that instance are now stuck in that Space even if you move the main program window to another Space. If you then move the unpinned menu window with F8 the cursor offsets of the windows are off so that, if the menu is the active window, you move your cursor somewhere else (I haven't figured the pattern) on the current Space to activate its choices. At this point all new menus now appear in this new Space to which you moved the unpinned window.

XQuartz 2.2.1 - (xorg-server 1.4.0-apple8)
