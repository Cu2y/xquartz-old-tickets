This is just a crash log. There's not much to go on... how did you hit this crash? Is it reproducible? Is it a regression?

Maybe related to <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/32737> in which I also couldn't get any info from the reporter...

I keep getting the above crash when I go to Colors → Curves.

What version of gimp and gtk are you using?

My version of GIMP is the latest (2.8.0). How do I get my GTK version on a Mac?



---

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Jul 11, 2012](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/591#comment:8 "July 11, 2012 at 12:22 PM PDT")*

That depends on how you installed GTK. How did you install GTK? If it's from MacPorts, then 'port installed gtk2':

    $ port installed gtk2
    The following ports are currently installed:
      gtk2 @2.24.10_2+universal+x11 (active)

If you installed it with fink, gentoo, or homebrew, then you'll need to issue whatever command is appropriate for those package systems.

If you installed it with a package, or bundled with gimp, then just point me to the package you used, so I can get the same binary.

afaik, it was bundled with GIMP. I downloaded it from here:
<http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gimponosx/GIMP-2.8.0p1-SnowLeopard-Lion.dmg?use_mirror=>

I launched gimp 2.8 and ran it in fullscreen, toggled fullscreen on/off a few times, painted with my stylus...

I went to Color-&gt;Curves and adjusted the curve for a while...

I couldn't get XQuartz to crash =/

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.7.3* to *2.7.4*

Deferring, unless I can get a way to reliably reproduce this...

I believe I have been running into this bug consistently using the fink build of GnuCash 2.4.11 on Mac OS X 10.6.8 running on a MacBookPro5,1 @ 2.53 GHz. XQuartz crashes every time I try to import a QIF file. The crash occurs when I am in the process of assigning expense accounts to my credit card transactions. I have never been able to process more than 3 transactions before XQuartz crashed.

The GDB backtrace of the crash is:

    Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
    Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000018

I can consistently repeat the problem with our product. Install EiffelStudio from MacPorts on Mac OS X 10.8.3 and using XQuartz 2.7.4 by issuing the following command:

sudo port install eiffelstudio72

Once installed, launch EiffelStudio create a basic project and let it compile. When compilation is finished, move the mouse over the \`groups' area and within a second it will crash while trying to display a tooltip.

In the meantime, I'll try to reproduce this on a smaller application.

I've not been able to reproduce this on a smaller example, but I put some more details on the failure in another similar bug report:

Did not realize that the code was badly formatted:

I'd like to reopen this one. I've recompiled the X server in debug mode and also I could not really debug it (gdb and MacOS behaves differently than on Linux/Unix), the stack trace of the thread that crashes now reads:

    Thread 2 Crashed:

     11 libsystem_c.dylib 0x00007fff99c451a1 thread_start + 13

The offending line 228 in damage.c is:

    for (; pDamage; pDamage = pNext) {
         pNext = pDamage->pNext;

So pDamage is not NULL but contains garbage for some reason.

I still cannot reproduce this on a small example, but if someone is willing to shadow me I have a setup in which this can be easily reproduced.
