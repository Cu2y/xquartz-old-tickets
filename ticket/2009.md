Xquartz 2.7.7 slow/long install and upgrade from 2.7.6 makes X11 and fc-cache use all CPU
=========================================================================================


When trying to upgrade from 2.7.6 to 2.7.7 the X11.bin process uses approx. 200% cpu and makes the fans run high. The fc-cache process doesn't even start. After 15 mins I have to quit the upgrade and my installation is still at 2.7.6.

After removing the entire installtion of XQuartz with AppCleaner and start installing 2.7.7 from scratch I get 100% cpu and 4 system load on fc-cache process for some 5 mins before it eventually completes.
