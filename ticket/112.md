Java3D apps displayed over X11 to Leopard don't produce any visuals
===================================================================


This is a case of running an app on a Solaris 10 box that utilizes Java3D with the X11 display on a Leopard machine (in this case running X11-2.2.1, but seems to occur with any Leopard Xquartz older or newer). What seems to happen is that the Java app is not able to determine the appropriate display capabilities and thus doesn't display anything except an empty gray window.

Note, this is a regression from Tiger X11 as it works fine there.

It would appear that the Leopard X11 is not producing a visual configuration that is acceptable to Java, but Tiger is (the exact same machine running Tiger produces 32 visuals according to glxinfo while Leopard produces 8).

I've attached xdpyinfo run from the Solaris machine asking the Mac X11 server its capabilities (solaris\_to\_Leopard.txt and solaris\_to\_Tiger.txt).

I've also attached glxinfo output running on the Mac in Leopard and Tiger (note, there is a crasher in Leopard running the command 'glxinfo -l'). The files are leopard\_glxinfo-l.txt, leopard\_glxinfo.txt and tiger\_glxinfo-l.txt.

Finally, I've also attached a simple Java3D app that will trigger the problem (the demo HelloUniverse java3D app can also be used to trigger it). The app is 'test.java'.

To test this, compiling and running this app on a Solaris machine with X11 displayed on a Leopard Mac will work. I did not have a Linux box available to test with so I couldn't try that in place of the Solaris box.

Finally, this may be related to ticket [\#⁠45](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/45) relating to stereo.

The OpenGL visuals and fbconfigs were broken in the release you were using. I have since then fixed the visuals, fbconfigs, and stereo support. Can you try using 2.3.2.1 to see if it fixes the problem? If not, I will try to use a Java app remotely with indirect rendering.

Sorry about the delay in responding to this after it was assigned to me...

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?
