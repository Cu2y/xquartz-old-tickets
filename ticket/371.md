Switching between two instances of an app with Cmd-\` (backtick) causes X11 to freeze
=====================================================================================


If I start two instances of an application (e.g. xman) and then switch between them with Cmd-\` (backtick) then X11 freezes (all apps). I have to quit X11 and restart.

On a Mac Pro with Mac OS X 10.6.3. Running XQuartz 2.5.0 (had the same problem with Apple X11 before installing 2.5.0 - problem is new so likely (?) introduced with 10.6.3).
