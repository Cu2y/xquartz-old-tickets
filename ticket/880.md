mouseclicks and keypresses do no register in the application
============================================================


I am using OSX 10.9.1 and xQuartz 2.7.5.
In a Terminal Windows (that I opened with Command-N in xQuartz), I ssh -X &lt;linux server&gt; and do a "visualvm" there. This starts VisualVM 1.35 (from <http://visualvm.java.net/download.html> ) on that server, with the GUI on my OSX client.

Now it seems the windows never gets active though:
I can hover over the license's buttons with the mouse pointer, they even do the hover animation (see 2 screenshots for this)
But: no click or keypress registers in the application.

The only thing I can do is close the window with the button on the upper left.

Is this something you already know? I could not find any information for this..
Please assist!

Thanks & all the best,

Bernard

Fixed by setting "defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm\_click\_through -bool true"

With click through disabled, the first click should give focus to the window. Subsequent clicks would goto the X11 application. Does that not match with the behavior you were seeing?

Odd, well sources are at <https://github.com/jeremyhu/quartz-wm> if you want to take a look at it. I wonder if the window just isn't activating for some reason (so every click is an activation)

Do you have source code to demonstrate the issue?

I observe the same problem in OS X 10.10 + XQuartz 2.7.7, with a remote connection on a linux box, running another java application.
I have checked with the visualVM application cited in this ticket description, and I see exactly the same problem also.
The "Click-through Inactive Windows" option once enabled allows to click on button, but not to get focus to text areas, preventing from entering any text.

This is very annoying as I have to run VNC server on the remote host for this specific application.
The common thing seems to be java in this problem.
What can we do to help on this issue ?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Cannot Reproduce*

No response in a year. No other reports. Closing.

If you can still reproduce this, please open a new ticket in the quartz-wm github with relevant information (eg: test with xev and xinput to see what's being sent to clinets) to track a fix.
