"X11 cannot be found" after installing XQuartz 2.7.3
====================================================


Hello -
I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.1... I installed an application that required the latest X11... I was referred to your site - downloaded and install 2.7.3 and now when I attempt to run the application I get a dialog box stating "X11 cannot be found"!

Help please!

You said "when I attempt to run the application, I get a dialog box"

What application are you referring to that you are trying to run? There is no such dialog in OS X or XQuartz.
