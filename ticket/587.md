libcairo-gobject is broken
==========================


XQuartz 2.7.2 ships with libcairo-gobject, but that library links to nonexistent libraries, so it's unusable.

$ otool -L /opt/X11/lib/libcairo-gobject.2.dylib
...

> /opt/local/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.7)
> /opt/local/lib/libgobject-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 3201.0.0, current version 3201.3.0)
> /opt/local/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 3201.0.0, current version 3201.3.0)
> /opt/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.1.0)

...

Installing MacPorts is not an option.

The description got messed up and I can't edit it. The list of libraries was:

       /opt/local/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.7)
        /opt/local/lib/libgobject-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 3201.0.0, current version 3201.3.0)
        /opt/local/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 3201.0.0, current version 3201.3.0)
        /opt/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.1.0)

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Blocker*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.3*

Thanks. The fix is to actually just not ship the gobject support. That snuck in because it found gobject on my system.

This ticket will track my adding logic to my build system to find issues like this before ship and to add --disable-glib (or whatever is appropriate) to cairo's configure args.

Thanks for the quick response. For applications that need it, is there a way to build cairo-gobject separately from the rest of cairo?

Well, you'll need to build glib2 for one thing. Then you can probably ./configure cairo as normal ad just run make from the appropriate subdirectory. I'm not sure though since I've never needed to ;)

I have this fixed locally, and it will be in the first beta of rc of 2.7.3
