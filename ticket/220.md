Closing one xterm causes others to close as well
================================================


Bug affecting XQuartz 2.3.0 and 2.3.1, OS X Leopard 10.5.6
I launch X11, which opens one xterm window. If I then open a second xterm window, through Command-N or through the menu, then exit this second window, the first xterm also closes, either immediately, or on mouse-over (or on clicking within the xterm window, if fast enough).

The bug may also be reproduced if the second application launched is xman or xlogo, and perhaps with other apps as well. When the second app is closed, the xterm dies either immediately or on mouse-over.
