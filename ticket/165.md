Input-follows-mouse even through frontmost non-X11 windows
==========================================================


Tooltips from X11 apps show through full-screen non-X11 windows. To reproduce, for example: 1) Open Pidgin in XQuartz. When buddies are present ikn buddy list, tooltips appear upon mouseover 2) Open MAc (non-X11) Firefox, and expand window to occupy entire screen. 3) Move mouse around in (frontmost) Firefox application. Effect: Tooltips from pidgin appear in front of firefox window. Possible Interpretation: X11 inout-follows-mouse behavior treats non-X11 windows as non-existent

This could be a feature... I mean if it accepted keyboard input as well it would be great for me! I can see that my xterm's think the window has focus even tho a native app has the foreground, its just key strokes actually go to the foreground app.

My 2 cents worth anyway :)

I don't see this... unless you have FFM enabled. Do you have FFM?

Sorry, yes this is with focus follows mouse enabled.

Ok, that's expected behavior and a limitation of the system that we can't work around. You just need to deal with that if you want FFM.
