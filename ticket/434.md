Java3D apps displayed back to Leopard via X11 don't display properly in Xquartz 2.5.1+
======================================================================================


This is a case of running an app on a Solaris 10 box that utilized Java3D displayed back onto a Leopard machine via X11. If the Leopard machine is running Xquartz 2.5.0, all is well and the graphics are displayed in the window properly.

However, if the Leopard machine is running Xquartz 2.5.1 or 2.5.2, then the graphics don't show in the window at all.

From the standpoint of the user, this is very similar to bug report [\#⁠112](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/112) which was first fixed in Xquartz 2.4.0 (the same java test program that was attached to bug report [\#⁠112](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/112) can be use to see the problem with 2.5.1 or later).

My guess would be something in the xserver change from 1.7.6 to 1.8.2 with Xquartz 2.5.1.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

This is already fixed in 2.5.3 which will probably be released this weekend or next week.
