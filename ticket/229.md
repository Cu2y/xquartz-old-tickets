Fonts no longer visible in OpenGL scene
=======================================


I'm running SYBYL 8.1 (<http://www.tripos.com>). v2.3.1 of XQuartz worked beautifully. v2.3.2 crashes on application start and v2.3.2.1 fonts are no longer visible.

The display area is an OpenGL context, if I run the same application with OpenGL disabled the fonts are visible. They are only not displayed when in OpenGL mode.

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?

I'm sorry, I can't test the specific issue as the application crashes with the following error:

BTW: 2.4.0\_beta1 gives the following error for the program on startup (the main screen flashes in X then comes down)

With 2.4.0 I have the same error, X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes), when i try to start xine. Before 2.4.0 everything was fine.

Questo è xine (X11 gui) - un riproduttore video libero v0.99.5.

Can you try 2.4.0 with the 1.4.2-apple47 server?

Hi, no news, it start the splash-screen and then it crash with the same error:

You updated the wrong file. You need to update X11.bin, not Xquartz.

Ok, well that's good. It means we can more easily narrow down the change.

Use this script to bisect down to the version difference that introduced the problem. You should edit the HI and LO variables in the script to be HI=47 and LO=&lt;whatever version last worked&gt; If 2.3.3 worked, use LO=42

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/browser/trunk/find_version_delta.sh>

Run it within Terminal.app, and it will download the X11.bins and replace them. Answer y/n for if it worked, and you should find the version regression.

Thanks.

Ok, the 46 is ok and works good! Thank a lot, let me know if i can help you in the future!

Interesting... I don't see many changes between 46 and 47 that should really cause something like this...

How are you building xine? Is it in MacPorts? fink? What is your configuration? Can you attach your ~/.xine/config file (or whatever it's named), so I can try to reproduce the problem.

Hi, i build xine (lib and ui) from sources latest stable versione, but i filled all dependencies with Macport. I had to patch them, replacing the file demux.c in the lib with an old one (1.16.1 i if remember good) and to patch the ui (<http://marc.info/?l=xine-devel&m=120610913015518&w=2>).

The first i did was to delete all ~/.xine dir, and now i cannot send you the new one (my mac is on repair....)

I have macbook pro unibody.

Are you on Snow Leopard now? How does 2.3.5 work? Have you tried 2.5.0?

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Version** changed from *2.3.2 (xserver-1.4.2-apple31)* to *2.6.3 (xserver-1.10.3)*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

If this wasn't fixed already, it's probably fixed in 2.6.3. Closing due to lack of feedback from reporter.
