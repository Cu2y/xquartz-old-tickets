xinput2 broken (mouse issues in games using wine like Mass effect, BF Bad company 2 and many more))
===================================================================================================


Hi, I am Paul the Tall from Paulthetall.com. I port games, did about 500 until now using wine(skin). And there are quite some games infected with a mouse issue that you can move it properly. Only a bit (in-game) but in the menu it just works fine. a couple of games infected:

Battlefield bad company 2
Mass Effect 2
Mass Effect
Medal of honor Airborne
many others

Well I have not much knowlegde of Quartz, but someone who does and is the head of wine development noted to file a bug up here:

See whole discussion and all the debug output up here.
<http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29844>

Files are detached in the attachment list at the top. Alexandre Julliart noted this:

*XInput2 can't be supported on Mac because it doesn't report relative events. File a bug with XQuartz.*

I use MacOsx 10.7.3 on My Imac
I use Snowleopard 10.6.8 on my Macbook Pro

On both systems I have the issue so are millions of other users
I hope you guys can help out.

Thanks

My take on this is that wine should use IORegistry to connect to the mouse directly instead of through the X server. There really is no good way for XQuartz to do this.

Xinput isn't broken. We just don't report relative motion.

Patches are certainly welcome, but I'm not going to sink effort into this when I have other priorities. Older versions of wine work just fine, so it looks like their fallback code doesn't work properly.

The 2.7.2 betas seem to include support for relative motion, but somehow it seems to make things worse rather than better. According to the last comment at <http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29844> , XQuartz is still sending absolute events.

I can reproduce a/the problem with Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta5 under Mac OS X 10.6.8. You can download the demo from <http://www.gamershell.com/download_4925.shtml>

After installing the game and starting it via PrinceOfPersia.EXE,

1.  go to the graphics options and disable "water effects" and "fog effects"
2.  start a new game
3.  press "w" until the intro movie starts (skip it using Esc)
4.  once the flyover of the first part of the demo level has finished, press and hold the "f" key, and while holding it move the mouse around. This activates "mouse look" and your view should follow your mouse movements. In practice, the viewport will focus on the ground and just turn in circles as you move your mouse

This worked fine with 2.7.1, when XQuartz still reported absolute movements. This may also be a Wine bug, but given that users on other platforms don't seem to have these problems, it may rather be an XQuartz issue. I'm using Wine 1.5.2, but I don't think it's specific to that version (it will probably happen with any Wine version that tries to make use of relative mouse movements via Xinput2, which is definitely 1.3.24 and later, and probably even some earlier versions too). I'm also not using an actual mouse, but the touchpad of my MBP. I don't know whether that's relevant.

Thanks for your work on this, especially given not exactly friendly welcome you received on the Wine bugtracker...

I ran this by Peter a couple weeks ago when I did this patch series. He's basically the expert / primary developer of Xinput, and he said that this was definitely a wine bug. Firstly, they should be able to handle the events as I was reporting them earlier with an absolute device. Now that the axis are relative, to make it what they want, they should be able to get the data they want even easier ... but I think I see an issue with this workaround.

If I run 'xinput --test-xi2' the RawMotion events are indeed the absolute coordinates that I fed in. It does seem odd to me that this is "correct" because the RawMotion data does indeed contain the absolute coordinates. Peter told me that if I feed in absolute coordinates to the dix for a relative axis, the dix should handle transforming those into relative values to pass on to clients, so the issue now may indeed be a server bug.

Even if we get relative events reported the way they want, you'll still be bound by the visible display as it's coded now. I'll have to look into whether or not the NSEvent's deltaX and deltaY contain information "past the border" which would be necessary here.

I think they do (at least I no longer experience any regressions anymore compared to when they only supported Xinput version 1), but the problem is that this is reportedly not always enough for dealing with Windows games. The issue is explained in a fairly detailed way in <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2010-December/000347.html> under "1. Absolute vs relative motion".

> If I run 'xinput --test-xi2' the RawMotion events are indeed the absolute coordinates that I fed in.

Peter told me that if I feed in absolute coordinates to the dix for a relative axis, the dix should handle transforming those into relative values to pass on to clients, so the issue now may indeed be a server bug.

That's indeed strange. Another issue, maybe related to what I am experiencing, may be due to the fix for <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46976> not yet being in XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta5 (at least I didn't see it listed among the commits).

> Even if we get relative events reported the way they want, you'll still be bound by the visible display as it's coded now. I'll have to look into whether or not the NSEvent's deltaX and deltaY contain information "past the border" which would be necessary here.

That's indeed the main reason they want relative movements afaik: to prevent losing events due to getting stuck at the edge of the screen. So only changing the reporting from absolute to relative indeed won't help much, I think (it may in fact worsen things, because the hack whereby they combine absolute events and warping the mouse cursor back to the center all the time won't then be used anymore).

The fix for <a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/548" class="missing ticket">#⁠46976</a> is in XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta5 (it was included in xorg-server-1.12.1 which is in 2.7.2\_beta5). Note who wrote the last message in the fd.o bug report ;)

Ok, I think I have a solution that I can include in 2.7.2\_rc1. I'm reverting the 0 and 1 valuators back to absolute and adding 2 new valuators as relative. I don't know if wine will handle this correctly, but if they don't then it's really their bug, and I'm not going to press it any further. They will now have all the data.
