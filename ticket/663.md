keybord shortcuts are based on language, not input method
=========================================================


I recently changed the preferred language of Snow Leopard from Swedish to English. I still use a Swedish keyboard layout though, and this combinations makes e.g. window switching difficult. For all other applications, **cmd-&lt;** and **cmd-&gt;** is still used for switching windows ('&lt;' is located between 'z' and shift on the Swedish keyboard), but under xquartz this changes to **cmd-\`** and **cmd-~**, which is inconvenient at it corresponds to pressing **cmd-shift-=** and **cmd-shift-alt-\]** on an American-English keyboard. It would make sense if such keyboard shortcuts followed their counterparts in the rest of the os.

I have not tested this with older versions, so the issue may be older than v. 2.7.4

This is not an issue that we can really fix at the X11 layer. We get all this data from OS X and build the X11 keymap to match.

You can override anything in the layout with ~/.Xmodmap

I'm thinking its something that \*shouldn't\* be fixed on an X11-level. The keys work as they should for me within e.g. a terminal window, it's just that the keyboard shortcuts that control the app itself seem dependent on the language for Xquartz.app in a way that is not consistent with other apps in OS X. And this is not something that can be fixed with .Xmodmap, for the shortcuts also appear in the menus of Xquartz.app, which in turn operate "outside" the X11 layer i presume. It seems to me that either OS X sends the wrong information (not Xquartz' fault, close the bug report), or Xquartz.app uses that information in the wrong way (Xquartz' fault, indeed a bug). Or am I mistaken?

I should add that apples X11.app behaves in the same way as Xquartz.app in this respect. But since the former is based on the latter, that's no big surprise. terminal.app, on the other hand, uses the same key combinations as other apps (cmd-\[&lt;&gt;\] for a Swedish keyboard layout).

To summarize: it still looks like a bug to me.

Best,

Erik

"keyboard shortcuts that control the app itself"

What shortcuts are you talking about?

I'm referring to the shortcuts that switch widows, cmd-\`and cmd-~ for the US-English keyboard. Other such commands would be cmd-Q for quitting Xquartz or cmd-W for closing a window, but those are not affected by the choice of language, only the window-switching shortcuts are problematic when OS X is set to use the English language in combination with certain non-English keyboard layouts.

To clarify: All other apps use the same physical keys for switching windows, regardless of what language I chose for OS X. Xquarts, however, does not, which requires me to change to a US-English keyboard layout if I want to avoid inconvenient combinations of keystrokes for switching windows.

CMD-Q quits XQuartz just like it quits TextEdit.
CMD-\` and CMD-~ cycle through windows in XQuartz like they do in TextEdit.

If your locale should be using something else other than CMD for these keys, then it should have the "window item modifiers" item in Localizable.strings edited to what it is supposed to be. It is not a function of the keyboard layout. It is a function of the lproj (which is a function of your inlt settings).

The sweedish lproj (sv.lproj) has "window item modifiers" = "command";

Is that incorrect? What should it be?

If you do this:
defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 window\_item\_modifiers "command+alt"

You'll then be able to use cmd-alt-1, cmd-alt-2, etc ... although that doesn't effect quit, cycle, and hide... I think we just inherit those from AppKit.

Please explain exactly what localization setting you have, what shortcut sequence is active (ie wrong), and what it should be (ie what would be correct).

Thanks.

I use English as the language of choice and the "Swedish - pro" keyboard layout. What I want is to use cmd-&lt; and cmd-&gt; for cycling through windows within Xquartz, since that corresponds to the same physical keys that cycle windows everywhere else in the OS, as set in my preferences.

System-wide keyboard shortcuts can be redefined via System Preferences-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Keyboard & Text Input. Most applications seem to honor those settings, but XQuartz doesn't. From looking at the contents of \*.lproj within XQuartz, the keys (defined as strings) for window cycling are hardcoded for a given language. So if I have set English as my preferred language I get cmd-\`and cmd-~ for window cycling regardless of keyboard layout or what I set in my system-wide preferences. I think that's the core of the problem. Is that making sense?

I've never developed applications for OS X, so I might very well have the wrong idea about some of these things.

Best,

Erik

Ok, well I have no idea how that is automated or what might be misconfigured =/

Neither do I, unfortunately. This ticket is a bit cluttered and some things I wrote in the beginning are a bit confusing. Perhaps one should close this one and I could file a new one with a more precise formulation of the problem.
