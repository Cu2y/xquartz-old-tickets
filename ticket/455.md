XDBE misbehaviour
=================


As reported yesterday on the mailinglist, use the double-buffer extension on an "unhappily chosen" Visual supporting that extension can lead to a server crash.
Even if a crash is not provoked, the display is not as it should be: the window image is split/doubled horizontally, and what is supposed to be a white background is rendered as purple or magenta. This happens on a MacBookPro7.1 with both the 10.6.5 Apple X11 server and the current XQuartz server (2.5.3). The incriminated visual is the 15bits deep TrueColor visual 0x363. When using the default visual (0x24; 24 bits TrueColor) no problems occur.

I've attached a stand-alone distribution of the software with which I discovered the issue. The attachment contains the executable with supporting libraries (built with -ggdb3 and full optimisation), source, scripts for building and a script for setting up the local environment (INSTALL.script.MacOSX).
NB: I have not yet been able to reproduce the crash with the attached version but the image corruption issue persists.

Some additional information:

-   change into the unpacked directory (xgraph)
-   when running a Bourne shell (sh, bash,...), do

. INSTALL.script.MacOSX

-   launch the app with for instance

xgraph -nodetach examples/DataAndPens.xg.bz2 \[-use\_XDBE\]

-   a Control-R in the graphic window redraws, a 'D' (Shift-d) keystroke duplicates the current window, both operations that would lead to a crash

<!-- -->

-   for building, use

cmake xgraph All DEBUG=-symbols

-   in order to rebuild all, precede that command with a

make remake
