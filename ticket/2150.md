The application X11 could not be opened
=======================================


I have a Mac Book PRO running Maverick (10.9.2) ... see attachment.
I go to /Application/utilities and double-click on XQuatz. A message pops up that reads as follows:

The application X11 could not be opened.
An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running"

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple. ==

If I click on REOPEN than the same error pops up on the screen:

The application X11 could not be opened.
An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running"

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

Please, take a look at the attachments. I do not know how to upload any attachment !!!

Please, help me ... I have a presentation in a conference on Tuesday July 22. I should be able to run Topas (a Monte Carlo code built on top of GEANT4). Topas runs fine but cannot open a graphic window through OpnGL because it uses XQuartz .....

Thank you in advance for your attention.

Regards,
maura

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Every report of this has been user error. You probably have bad permissions on /tmp or deleted /tmp. Please ask on x11-users for additional help if that piece of information is not enough to get you on your way.
