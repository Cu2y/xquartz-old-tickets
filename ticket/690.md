Crash after pasting when running Emacs on NX client (NeatX server)
==================================================================


My X11 session is intermittently crashing when pasting within Emacs. I've tried running Emacs over OpenNX (<http://opennx.net/download.html>) and NoMachine's NoMachine Player. Both are encountering the same issue. I'm happy to dole out any additional information required.

That's an issue with emacs crashing on your remote system.
