Fullscreen mode support in Lion
===============================


It would be great if proper fullscreen support for individual X windows (using the 'fullscreen' widget in the top right hand corners of windows) could be introduced under lion. The current fullscreen support does not create its own space, and any open windows are closed when switching spaces.

I'm also interested in this. Its about time we got this fixed, I could be willing to help if I can figure out how to load the source to an xtools project.

It's not an Xcode project. It's an autotools based project. See: <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/DeveloperInfo>

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
