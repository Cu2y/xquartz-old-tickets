long start-up time in snowleopard
=================================


Since I updated my Mac to SnowLeopard, both X11 provided by Apple or XQuartz do not start up immediately anymore. X11 does not start at all. XQuartz takes more than one hour, close to two before starting up. Looking at the console messages, the same message is repeated all the time until some time-out comes in I suppose. One occurence of the message is in an attached file to this ticket. Once XQuartz has started, X11 starts immediately if I click on it.
It is very painful because I use X11 a lot and each time I restart it I lose a couple of hours waiting for it. I have searched the web, the forums etc without finding any working hint.
I need your help!!! Thanks.

For a quicker response, please ask for help in the x11-users mailing list. It's probably an issue with your configuration ... are you setting $DISPLAY in a startup script perhaps?

This seems likely to be your problem:

What login shell do you use (please respond on the list)?

Yeah... judging by other google search results, my guess is you have a bad ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile:

In principle, no. I have seen this $DISPLAY problem comment before. In my account, I don't use it in the .xxxrc, .login, etc. files. Should I repost in the x11-users mailing list then ?

No, this has nothing to do with my problem. This error appeared afterwards once I installed the intel fortran compiler. It is a problem with their startup file which I did not bother to solve yet.

tcsh (which list ?)

No, this intel message does not prevent the use of the compiler and as I said above, it appeared much after I moved to SL and the problem did not exist with Leopard. In between I changed no config file at all, simply upgraded to SL, updated Xcode and downloaded the latest version of XQuartz.

"the problem did not exist with Leopard" : I mean the slow starting problem (the ia32,ifort64 appeared only when I upgraded ifort which did not work any longer with SL)
