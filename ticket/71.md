Mouse freezes when switching displays while sleeping
====================================================


On a MacBook Pro, running 10.5.2, X11 2.1.4, and (if it matters) Spaces enabled:

This Mac is connected to an external monitor at work with higher resolution than the native laptop display (which is disabled/lid closed). When put to sleep, and awoken at home without the external display (laptop screen only), the mouse doesn't work in X11 anymore. It stays stuck in the top left corner, can't be moved, and doesn't seem to be responsive to mouse clicks. The only remedy that seems to be available is to quit X11 and restart. There is no problem with any of the other applications.

Possibly related to bug [\#⁠64](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/64). ALT-Tab'ing doesn't help in that instance, though.

If an X application starts, is it displayed, or is X actually frozen?

If you can start an X application, can you run 'xev' from Terminal.app. Try moving the mouse with xev focused. Is there output in Terminal.app? What about mouse clicks?

do you get key presses? Can you cmd-tilde through X windows?

I can start/quit X applications, X is not frozen and responds to keystrokes (including cmd-tilde).
xev confirms that X is fully responsive to keystrokes, but that the mouse is completely frozen (mouse clicks also don't register).

It is as if the mouse got unplugged while the computer was sleeping, except that, for some reason, upon wake-up, the mouse pointer is anchored on the top left of the screen.

[\#⁠64](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/64) seems to say that Command-Tab did work, perhaps a duplicate?

I read [\#⁠64](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/64) again. It is possibly a duplicate indeed; I might have misunderstood the bug report. Cmd-tab does allow switching to a different application and getting a working pointer, but it doesn't solve the problem for X11; i.e., when the focus in on X11, the pointer irremediably stay stuck in the top-left corner until X11 is quit and restarted.

Can you please install 2.2.0.1, then try Xquartz-1.4.0-apple2

-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

I think this is fixed with 1.4.0-apple9 ... no response from submitter, so closing

Agree - have not seen the issue since.
