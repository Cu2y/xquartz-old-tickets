Ubuntu Unity incompatibility
============================


XDMCP (X -query ...) sessions to ubuntu 12.10 system with "unity" desktop has issues with RENDER extension and 3D acceleration being required by remote system. XQuartz sometimes crashes during session start in that configuration. The remote greeter is displayed correctly, however.
There also seem to be keyboard mapping issues. When using the remote "metacity" window manager, typing a "d" on its own causes all windows to be hidden, however on the remote system this is configured to the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+alt+D".
Sometimes, in the greeter, there is no keyboard or mouse focus, so it's impossible to select a different session type etc.
