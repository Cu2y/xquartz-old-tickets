No 8-bit PseudoColor visual (?)
===============================


One of the standard astronomy tools is an X11 application known as "ximtool"; it requires
an 8-bit pseudocolor visual. Under Tiger and standard X11 I could invoke this by doing an X11--&gt;preferences---&gt;output---&gt;colors (hundreds). But, under Leopard X11 the only options appear to be millions and thousands. I've tried downloading XQuartaz X11-2.3.1rc3, hoping that maybe this was now fixed. I've read through some open tickets that imply that the 8-bit problem has been fixed, but if so, apparently you don't invoke it the way I've been trying to.

thanks.
