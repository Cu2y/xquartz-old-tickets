X11 window not updated until (long) time out OR window movement
===============================================================


Hi,

I do a lot of remote plotting: the (large) data sets live on a remote Linux box, into which I ssh (with X forwarding, ofcourse) and run a plotting script. The script open an X11 window and draws on it.
Recently I started to see (very) long delays between redraws, e.g. when moving to the next page. Sometimes it takes 10 seconds for the window to redraw. The plotting itself is quick - when logged in from another Linux machine the next page draws immediately.

It seems to have started when I upgraded to the latest X11 (2.7.7) just a few weeks ago. I downgraded to 2.7.6 but the problem persisted.

I am on OSX 10.9.3.

I also found something that may be a hint as to what is going wrong. If I move to the next page and nothing happens for a second, I pick up the window and move it a few pixels and tada, there are my plots, almost instantaneously. If I don't move the window (force a refresh?) it takes many many seconds for the window to update.

This is really annoying and I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to diagnose, identify or help fixing the problem.

Thanks in advance for your great work!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Cannot Reproduce*

Sorry for the delay, but this sounds like an app problem and not a server problem.
