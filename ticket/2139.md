CUBIT v14 and v15 crashes on Mac OS X v10.9.3 and XQuartz v2.7.7 and v2.7.8\_rc1
================================================================================


\[ Problem \]

On an Apple Mac laptop running Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 along with XQuartz 2.7.7, the "CUBIT" application software (cubit.sandia.gov) running remotely crashes as shown in the transcript below. The crash occurs on Cubit versions 14 and 15.

\[ Testing \]

These software downloads of "XQuartz" were installed and tested from xquartz.macosforge.org:

    - Stable version "XQuartz-2.7.7" (originally installed)
    - Development version "XQuartz-2.7.8_rc1"
    - Prior version "XQuartz-2.7.6"

\[ Solution \]

The prior version "XQuartz-2.7.6" was found to resolve the crashing problem with Cubit v14 and v15.
