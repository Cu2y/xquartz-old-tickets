X11 not repsonsive on mac os x 10.8.2
=====================================


I have been using a program that utilizes X11 windows. Last night I upgraded my os x to 10.8.2 then when I tried to use the program to X11 windows did not pop-up any more. I am using the lastest version of XQuartz (2.7.3) and it works well with 10.8.1 before I upgraded last night.

XQuartz works fine here on 10.8.2.

Please joint he x11-users mailing list and ask for help. Please provide more details when you do.

What program are you using? Are you able to launch XQuartz directly? Can you launch an xterm? ...

Maybe he uses fullscreen X11? See here <http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=61>
Wineskin ships its own X11 server, yet it bases on XQuartz and starting with 10.8.2/10.7.5 changing resolution fails and it also makes XQuartz hang when I tell Wineskin to use XQuartz instead its own server (in a futile attempt to change screen res)
