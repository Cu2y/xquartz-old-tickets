Unable to install XQuartz
=========================


Hi,
I downloaded the latest version of XQuartz and tried to install it on my MacBook Pro and got an error message.
I'm fairly new to IOS and don't know what I did wrong.
I've attached screen shots showing the XQuartz version and the error message when I clicked to install it. My MacBook Pro specification is also attached.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Cher
