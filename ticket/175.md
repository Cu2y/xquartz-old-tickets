Garbled fonts with XQuartz on PPC
=================================


I've been having similar problems to that described here:

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/92>

I'm using OS-X 10.5.5, XQuartz 2.3.1 on a G5 tower.

Certain applications using X11 produce totally garbled fonts (as seen in the screenshot attached and on above report) while others are fine. The only difference as AFAICS is that the problematic apps are all QT / Tk-based, while GTK ones seem to be fine. This may not be a general rule though. Installing the original Apple X11 package fixes the problem, but is obviously not ideal. I've tried all the steps outlined in the above ticket to no avail. Any help appreciated.

This isn't a bug in X11. This is a bug in the macports version of fontconfig or QT or something like that. Rebuild fontconfig and qt and I think you'll be fine. If not, report your problem to fink or macports or wherever you're getting your apps from
