Launch .desktop files
=====================


It would be nice to be able to launch .desktop files. For instance, Winetricks seems to have moved to having separate Wine prefixes for each game with a .desktop launcher and I don't want to run Nautilus to run these games.

Yeah, that's certainly a "nice to have" though ... we could certainly associate a .desktop file with XQuartz.app, but I'm not really sure what to do from there. The spec is here:
<http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-1.0.html>

There's really no way that we'll be able to realistically support all the functionality (like file associations), but it would be nice to double click a .desktop and have it "just work"

I guess I could just read the file and look for the "Exec=" line...

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
