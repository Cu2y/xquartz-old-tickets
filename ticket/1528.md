Font/text
=========


Font and text in X is literally always completely screwed up for me in every application. I don't know what happened, but all of my text is split and half and both sides are reflected about the middle. Is this a known problem? I've attached a photo.

Wow. How are you reproducing that? Are you building firefox yourself? sshing to another system?
