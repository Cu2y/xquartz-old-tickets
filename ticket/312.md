2.4.1a1 installer hangs
=======================


On my MBP running 10.6.1 the installer for 2.4.1a1 gets stuck at the "Preparing SnowLeopard X11 2.4.1\_alpha1" stage. I have been unable to install X11 because of this. This possibly relevant message appears in the console:

9/21/09 2:56:02 PM Installer\[19872\] **\* -\[NSMachPort handlePortMessage:\]: dropping incoming DO message because the connection or ports are invalid
**

Activity Monitor shows a "runner" sub-process of Installer, but I can't sample it and I don't have any idea what it's doing. It's not using CPU or growing in memory.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.1*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

Please redownload and verify the checksum. This sounds like an installer bug and is not an X11 bug. If the problem persists, please file a bug at <http://bugreport.apple.com>, and let me know the radar number, so I can track it.

It turns out this was a bug in Installer.app that was solved by a simple reboot. Sorry for the noise.
