xquartz 2.7.4 terminates without notice
=======================================


MacOS 10.8.5, iMac
xquartz 2.7.4 terminates without notice after about 4 minutes of being launched, even without an app launched/actively running. No crash report is generated to submit to Apple, but the following log content is generated:

X11.app: main(): argc=2

Working now. Deleted the xquartz app (it had already been updated to 2.7.4, but I decided maybe something went wrong with prior install under older OS); downloaded a new disk image for the latest xquartz version (2.7.4), reinstalled it, and now it works fine. This is strange because 2.7.4 had already been installed previously, yet the terminal was quitting without warning. I can only surmise that there must have been something faulty with the app installation under a previous OS version, and reinstalling it under Mountain Lion corrected the issue.
