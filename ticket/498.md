Mouse "escapes" from screen when playing in wine (Randr and windowed modes)
===========================================================================


With XQuartz 2.6.2 and above, MacPorts X11 (Devel and stable) and the 2.7.0 beta1:

This happens when I open wine and any game, ej, Worms 2, and the mouse "escapes" from the screen so is not possible to move the mouse while game. (Wine uses XInput implementation)

The problem persists both full screen and windowed modes.

I'm posting here the problem because is not related to wine (With Apple X11 and XQuartz versions prior 2.6.2 this doesn't happens). I'm using Snow Leopard 10.6.8.

With XQuartz 2.6.1 (Xorg 1.9.5) works fine.

Anyway, thanks for developing XQuartz.

-   **Type** changed from *crash* to *usability*
-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** changed from *2.6.3 (xserver-1.10.3)* to *2.6.2 (xserver-1.10.1)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.0*

Nothing changed in XQuartz here, so I suspect this is an issue with going from 1.9.x to the 1.10.x server.

Can you give more detail about what you mean by "escapes"? Are these games that show a cursor on the screen, or are they ones which capture the mouse and let the mouse control your character?

I've recorded with a camera and reproduced the bug with **XQuartz 2.6.3**

<http://archivos2.tie.cl/motumbo/Mac/X11/M4H00692.MP4>

As you can see, when the game start, the game camera goes to the lower right corner of the screen and I cant move it, the same is happening with the game menu, the cursor is blocked to the center of the screen.

You might be interested to know that Quicktime X allows you to do screen capture recordings ...

Ok, I see what you mean.

Can you try sshing in from another machine while it's in this state and run 'DISPLAY=XXX xinput test pointer'

You'll need to replace the XXX there with the appropriate value for your server. Before running wine, run 'echo $DISPLAY' to get that value. It'll probably be a path with some random characters in it, so you may want to just save it to a file for future use:

    local $ echo $DISPLAY > mydisplay
    local $ wine explorer

    remomote $ ssh local
    local $ DISPLAY=`cat mydisplay` xinput test pointer

Can you also please give XQuartz-2.7.0-beta1 a try. That moves us up to the 1.11 server, and maybe this "just works" now. If so, I'll try to figure out what needs to be pulled back to the 1.10.x branch to address this.

Quicktime X releases the mouse when I press the hotkey to stop recording.

$DISPLAY is /tmp/launch-XUVYth/org.macosforge.xquartz:0
After starting the game, pointer tries to lock on position **motion a\[0\]=383 a\[1\]=312**

I've attached the output

With XQuartz 2.7.0 beta1 happens the same.

That xinput behavior is what I've seen for wine. It always warps the mouse to the center, uses deltas from that, then warps it back.

This is really odd. I'm not sure what has changed here (certainly nothing in the XQuartz DDX), so I'm gonna do some more research.

What other games have you tried under wine? Have you tried any FPS like quake?

Yep, I've tried with Max Payne and Counter Strike 1.6, and the bug is still present.
The only games that work fine are the games who doesn't use directx/fullscreen/3d.

PD: Wine 1.3.18

**Support for mouse pointer clipping.
Raw mouse events support using XInput2.**
First steps of a DIB engine implementation.
More properties supported in DXDiag.
New security tab in the Internet control panel.
Improved video playback on Mac OS X.
Various bug fixes.

Wine 1.3.21

Support for installation rollbacks in MSI
8- and 16-bit bitmap formats in the DIB engine
**Fixes in the XInput2 mouse support**
Better support for text shaping in Uniscribe
Improvements to the Item common dialog
More MSVC runtime functions
Various bug fixes

Por ahí va la cosa

Here's the fix, which will revert wine to the old mouse processing (since OS X does not support relative mouse reports AFAIK):

This bug is still fixed. You may have another bug. Also note that I am tracking down an input regression \*in wine\*. Currently, I know that wine-1.3.15 worked and wine-1.3.21 didn't. I'm still bisecting. Your bug may be that wine bug, so I suggest you see if wine-1.3.15 works for you.

Ah maybe the regression that I'm seeing is caused by their Xinput2 use you mention in .18 ... in any event, I see this problem with older servers as well... hmm...

Wine 1.3.31 works fine in XQuartz 2.7.0 beta 2 (XQuartz from PKG, Wine-Devel from MacPorts)

Hmm I will try with the old and "stable" Wine 1.2.3 + XQuartz 2.7.0 RC1, but I don't think that the bug is relaying on Wine, maybe if I compile Wine again because MacPorts is always updating his port base...

With 2.7.0\_beta2, the recent wine fails "differently" than with XQuartz 2.7.0\_rc1 ... I'm looking into it, but yeah... different bug. Could you open a new one?

Tried with Wine 1.2.3 and 1.3.15, same bug.

I know that Wine is much more prone to bugs, but the issue is still happening with XQuartz 2.7.0 beta 3 and above

No, it most certainly is a \*different\* bug with the same symptoms for you. Please open a new ticket.
