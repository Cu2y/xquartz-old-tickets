Issues with Multi-monitor (&gt;2) support in OSX Mavericks
==========================================================


I'd hoped that 2.7.7 would fix this, but the extant issues seem to be only with dual monitor support, not for 3 or more.

I'm running X11 with a 2012 Retina MBP, OSX 10.9.4 with two Apple external monitors that I connect via Thunderbolt.

Whenever I connect the 2nd monitor (3 screens total), all of the existing X windows disappear and I cannot bring them to the front, zoom, etc. They appear to exist "off screen" somewhere.

> I can see the missing windows in Mission Control, and drag them to different monitors but still can't access them.
> I can remove one monitor and they all reappear. But if I reconnect the 2nd monitor, the X windows all disappear again.
> New windows (created after all monitors are connected) are fine, however.

This has only been an issue since Mavericks. It worked fine under Mountain Lion.

I have a similar problem with a 2-display setup (and had hoped that 2.7.7 would fix the problem as well). When I connect my external monitor (so that I am using the external monitor and the builtin display on my MBP), existing X windows disappear as described in the opening post.

I played around a bit with the display settings and the windows only disappear when the external display is situated to the left of the builtin display. When the external display is situated to the right of the builtin display, the windows appear normally onscreen.

I'm having a similar issue.

It appears to me like the windows are getting moved so that they are owned/displayed in the second monitor, but positioned for display in the first monitor.

In my case the first monitor is to the right of the second. In Mission Control the hidden window animates from the right as if they are zoomed on the monitor on the right.

The only way to get them back is to drag them to the first monitor from Mission Control, then click Zoom in the top menu so that they fill the first monitor. Then I move them to where they should be.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
