fullscreen focus/pointer or window stacking order bug
=====================================================


Hi,

I'm using git head on OS 10.8 and have had an annoying problem since about 2.6.0 (as best as I can remember) with fullscreen XQuartz (i.e. NOT rootless) and openbox.

I use "focus follows mouse" and everything works as expected until I change workspaces. After that, all the windows on that workspace behave oddly.

The mouseover focus works as expected. However something is very wrong with the "window regions" that \*should\* be receiving clicks to "raise" them to the top. Specifically, clicking on some windows sometimes actually lowers them instead!

The behavior does \*not\* seem to be random; rather, very deterministic, leading me to think there is some kind of bug in the routines that handle changing focus/pointer with the root window (dix/enterleave.c), although I'm not super familiar with the code...

My current "user behavior" workaround is to either:

-   use alt-tab to specifically raise a window, at which point all windows' regions seem to work again immediately
-   click around on each non-overlapping perimeter of each window until all windows' regions seem to work again

Sometimes it seems like X11's idea of the window stacking order, perhaps, does not honor the window manager's window stacking order. But I've never had this issue with openbox under Linux or BSD X11. And clicking non-overlapping areas of windows does \*not\* fix the problem until I really explore the perimeter of the windows.

I traced it down to the following change:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver/commit/miext/rootless/rootlessWindow.c?id=4fc4cab98d454afbfd0d2f48548b5b481e8e7c82>

Here is my diff against HEAD to fix the behavior, for me; obviously not a complete fix:

    diff --git a/miext/rootless/rootlessWindow.c b/miext/rootless/rootlessWindow.c
    index cfcb6e5..eb600cd 100644
    --- a/miext/rootless/rootlessWindow.c

             newPrevW = pWin->prevSib;
             while (newPrevW &&
    -               (WINREC(newPrevW) == NULL || !newPrevW->realized ||
    -                newPrevW->rootlessUnhittable != pWin->rootlessUnhittable))
    +               (WINREC(newPrevW) == NULL || !newPrevW->realized))
                 newPrevW = newPrevW->prevSib;

             newPrev = newPrevW != NULL ? WINREC(newPrevW) : NULL;

I noticed the same behavior with other window managers (I tried Openbox and Window Maker, and they both exhibit the problem), so I am very surprised no one else using fullscreen X hasn't been seeing this issue. Cheers.

Hmm...

Can you add some more diagnostics to look into this more? This would seem to imply that you have a window which is being marked as not hittable even though it is hittable.

-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.5*

I'm bringing this into 2.7.5. If you can figure out a fix (or more information that leads to a fix) in the next ~month, we can bring this into the release.

Were you able to investigate this any further or come up with a fix? If so, I'll bring it back into 2.7.6

No... when is the release planned? 3 weeks? I'll try but now is a busy time for me...

Probably sometime in the next month or so. I just put out 2.7.6\_rc1 and will likely release it soon after xorg-server-1.14.6 is released.
