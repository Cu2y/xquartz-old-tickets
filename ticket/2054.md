xinit occupies CPU!
===================


Hello.

I'm still using XQuartz 2.7.6 because 2.7.7 causes some significant error as below.
Recently, I updated to Yosemite and after that sometime xinit occupies up CPU.

If I find that, just restarting X11 will solve the problem at that time.
But, some time later it happens again.

Do you have any idea on this?

Thank you in advance.
Genie

P.S.
Maybe below is related to GLX(?). I don't really know

======================================================================

Please attach a spindump taken while the problem is occurring. xinit doesn't really do anything but wait after kicking off the server and client processes.

It mostly happens when I left Mac for long time until it goes into screen savor.
Problem comes with mtmd process run.

I attach spindump file.

When xinit or XQuartz kept CPU occupancy high, mtmd is also running with high occupation of CPU.

XQuartz.app was idle as well modulo some Sparkle activity that is all below DesktopServicesPriv.framework. I suspect it was checking for a new version of XQuartz.app during your inactivity.

mtmd spins up when you're idle to make use of the inactivity. It's a system service related to Time Machine.

In fact, I don't know how to read that file.

CPU time of X11.bin is comparable to mtmd.

Anyway, I'll just restart XQuartz.app whenever it happens because I cannot update to 2.7.7 due to GLX error......

Thank you.
