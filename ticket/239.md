Xnest to solaris 10 server, spacebar only works on alternate hits
=================================================================


Have Solaris 10 installed in VMWare Fusion. Using Xnest to log in works fine except that I have to press space twice for every space I want to insert when typing. Every other spacebar hit is ignored.

Problem does not exhibit itself on Xnest when run from Ubuntu Intrepid to same Solaris 10 vm.

Tried on vanilla x11 osx install, then installed xquartz, no difference.

(Xephyr doesn't work at all pointing at solaris 10 box, on either osx or ubuntu, different issue.)

(nb: have installed 2.3.2.1, but that's not in the version menu when reporting bugs)

Problem also occurs when connecting to an 'on the metal' installation of OpenSolaris.

Should have mentioned the version numbers:
Xquartz 2.1.5 - (xorg-server 1.3.0-apple22) (2.1.5)
