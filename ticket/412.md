XSetWindowBorder calls not being reflected on-screen
====================================================


i am using the ratpoison window manager which draws simple borders around windows with XSetWindowBorder. when the active window changes, it calls XSetWindowBorder on the current active window, and again on the new active window to draw their borders with different colors.

what happens is that these calls sometimes do nothing. sometimes they will redraw the window border, and sometimes the window borders all stay the same color. in the attached screen shot, the border (2 pixels surrounding the xterm) is actually filled with the old pixels that were there prior to resizing it.

i noticed this same behavior under vmware with the xf86-video-vmware driver. the vmware driver uses ShadowFB to get notified of dirty rectangles, and apparently window border changes are not included in these notifications, so they never get redrawn unless the window changes size. i worked around it in the vmware driver by always redrawing the entire screen instead of just the dirty rectangle coordinates.

i'm not sure if xquartz uses ShadowFB the same way, but the behavior is identical and is reproducible in xquartz 2.3.5 and 2.5.

-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

I'm tracking the fd.o bug for this since it seems to not be exclusive to XQuartz. We don't have an appropriate resolution for this, so I'm just picking "invalid"
