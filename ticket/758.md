status: closed
type: crash
resolution: Invalid

priority: Blocker
component: x11-apps
version: 2.7.4 (xserver-1.13.0)
keywords: POSIX ACL Permissions Group

XQuartz or X11 are not respecting any sort of group permissions
===============================================================


Steps to Reproduce:

-   Create local group, add your user account to it.
-   Follow command line commands below from Terminal.app to create a directory on your desktop with no POSIX user access but POSIX and ACL group access.

computername:~ username$ mkdir ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest

computername:~ username$ sudo chmod 770 ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest

computername:~ username$ sudo chown root:xquartztest ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest

computername:~ username$ sudo chmod +a "xquartztest allow list,add\_file,search,add\_subdirectory,delete\_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file\_inherit,directory\_inherit" ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest

computername:Desktop username$ cd ~/Desktop/

computername:Desktop username$ ls -el

drwxrwx---+ 2 root xquartztest 68 3 Jul 15:56 XQuartzTest

> 0: group:xquartztest allow list,add\_file,search,add\_subdirectory,delete\_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file\_inherit,directory\_inherit

Expected Results:

Should be able to get permission to create a file in the XQuartzTest directory from xterm in XQuartz (10.8.4) or X11 (10.7.5, 10.6.8).

Note that this following output is from Terminal.app where this works. It also works from the Finder or indeed if connected to this folder via an AFP sharepoint.

computername:Desktop username$ cd ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest/

computername:XQuartzTest username$ touch testing

computername:XQuartzTest username$ ls -l

total 0

-rw-r--r-- 1 username xquartztest 0 3 Jul 15:32 testing

Actual Results:

Note - this output is from xterm with XQuartz (10.8.4) and X11 (10.7.5/10.6.8).

bash-3.2$ cd ~/Desktop/XQuartzTest/

bash: cd: /Users/username/Desktop/XQuartzTest/: Permission denied

Regression:

I've tested this on the following (assume all current Apple software updates installed).

10.8.4 with XQuartz 2.7.4
10.7.5 with X11 and the X11 Update for 10.7.5 (<http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1605>)
10.6.8 with X11

Notes:

We first encountered this bug with our XSan which is currently hosted on XSan 2.2.2 with 10.6.8 server. A user who had for a long time used an X11 app (<http://martinos.org/mne/index.html>) for analysing data on the XSan volume. After an absence he came back and found that X11 no longer allowed him to get access to his data. While I'm not 100% sure the period he was away would have seen us update from 10.6.x to 10.6.8.

However I'm now seeing it across the board with current versions of 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8.

Logout and back in to ensure that processes have the correct getgroups()

Works fine for me with urxvt as my terminal. Doesn't work with xterm. Looks like an xterm bug.

Replying to [craigrichardson@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/758):

Thanks for looking at this, we agree that urxvt and terminal are unaffected however this is precisely the point, the xterm that is being provided by the XQuartz package is affected and we would like it to be fixed in an upcoming release. What would be the process to get this patched or updated?

thanks,
Craig

You should contact Thomas Dickey, the developer of xterm. See: <http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2013-May/055738.html>

It would probably be a good idea to figure out what version of xterm introduced the bug by bisecting from the last known working version.

Thankyou, I've submitted this bug to the xorg bugzilla and it has assigned it to Thomas to take a look at.

cheers,
Craig
