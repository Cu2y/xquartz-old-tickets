Strange white rectangles
========================


Dupes: [\#⁠19](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/19) [\#⁠173](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/173)

I'm getting some "random" white rectangles on my screen. They appear over other windows and I seem to have 3 of them (and 3 X11 windows open). They even survive changing applications, hiding others, and changing the background picture.

The reason I think it's an X11 window is that as I close each window, one of the boxes goes away. All X11 windows closed, all boxes gone.

I'm attaching a screenshot.

This is with the X11 2.1.0.pkg installed over a virgin Leopard 10.5.1.

Interesting, I've been seeing boxes like that but only when I use spaces. Does it go away with any use of spaces or expose? Can you see if it exists for you without using quartz-wm?

To do that, you'll need to create your own ~/.xinitrc file with these contents (without the ---start--- and ---end---):
--- start ---
. /etc/profile
exec xterm
--- end ---

This should get you an xterm without any window borders. Do you still have the white boxes?

Well, they do not appear immediately when I run without the wm, but I don't think they appear immediately with quartz-wm either. I will try running with twm for a little bit and see if they come back--and I will turn Spaces back on.

I see this problem repeatably when the following events all coincide:

1.  I have minimized X11 windows
2.  I sleep the mac
3.  I wake the mac up with a different resolution screen

Independently of any use of spaces or user switching.

If I query the strange and mysterious rectangles with xwininfo it says they are the root window.

If I restore (un-minimize) the offending window(s), I see that the white rectangle was exactly where the window restored to, and the white rectangle subsequently disappears.

Seems to be the same as [\#⁠19](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/19)

I see this too in the context of running a laptop sometimes with an external monitor and sometimes without. The external monitor is not mirrored and is configured to be the main monitor (ie, has the menu bar) when available. In detail:

1.  Running laptop by itself, minimize some windows or allow the app to unmap them (transient menu windows are good for this).

<!-- -->

1.  Close laptop to put it to sleep.

<!-- -->

1.  Connect external monitor.

<!-- -->

1.  Wake laptop.

All the X11 windows move to the external screen, which is fine, but there are white rectangles in the places where the minimized or
unmapped windows would have been if they weren't minimized/unmapped.

The rectangles only seem to go away if the windows are remapped or destroyed (by killing the owning application).

I think I've seen similar behavior in the reverse direction (removing external monitor to make windows move back to laptop screen)
but I'm not totally sure at the moment.

My way of reproducing this bug:

-   Start X11.app and an XTerm
-   Control-RightClick in the xterm to bring up the "VT Fonts" window.
-   Release the window. (At this point X11 unmaps the window, but it's still registered with the Xserver. You can tell this by bringing it up again and seeing that it's quicker to appear now. The client doesn't have to build the window, it just remaps it.)
-   Switch to a different user using FastUserSwitching
-   Switch back
-   See a "Strange White Rectangle" where the "VT Fonts" window once was. It appears that X11.app still knows that the window shouldn't be mapped, but the Apple's windowing system (Quartz, I guess) forgets and tries to redraw the window. So, it's only partially redrawn, hence the "Strange Whiteness".
-   You can get rid of the white rectangle by either remapping the "VT Fonts" window with a Control-RightClick or by exiting the xterm.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** changed from *3.0* to *2.3.2*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

I think this should now be fixed in:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?h=xorg-server-1.4-apple&id=3269959033ed0c675a3a906666454df34086896a>

This will be included in the forthcoming 2.3.2\_rc4

confirmed - this is resolved in 2.3.2 - thanks!
