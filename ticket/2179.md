Installer looks for /etc/ssh{,d}\_config in wrong place
=======================================================


The installer wants to modify /etc/ssh{,d} to add 'XAuthLocation'; however MacOS keeps these files under /private/etc/ssh. So installing XQuartz leaves me with stub files in /etc with just the "added by XQuartz" bits.

This was with the installer from the 2.7.8\_rc1 package.
