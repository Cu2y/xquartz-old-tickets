The screen is all pink, and only one screen has such problem.

What do you mean "only one screen has such problem"? Do you mean only one window has that problem? Can you please tell me more about that window (use xwininfo -all). Can you tell me how to reproduce the issue?

Is this a regression? If so, what was the last XQuartz version that worked for you?

Can you try changing the color depth in preferences-&gt;output to see if that has any effect?

I have the same problem with an in-house application, and changing the color depth does not help. For 256 the application is not starting anymore and for the others the same pink behavior.
