dead screen areas when changing monitors
========================================


The X server doesn't seem to respond well to changes in monitor size: the area in which it can receive events remains unchanged despite an alteration in screen size. (Note that it can *draw* everywhere.)

Steps to replicate bug:

1.  start the X server and an X program
2.  suspend the machine
3.  attach a larger monitor
4.  wake the machine
5.  resize the X program (via clicking the green button in the title bar perhaps.)

At this point, the window will not receive events outside of the rectangle equal in size to the original monitor positioned in the top left corner of the screen.

This is a very annoying behaviour when one has started a program on the laptop and then attach a big monitor at work running in lid-closed mode.
