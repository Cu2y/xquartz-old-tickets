xterm loss of focus / SuperDuper!
=================================


Hi- I'm encountering a "loss of focus" issue where my cursor in the xterm will momentarily stop accepting keystrokes and then return. It is frequent enough to impede my workflow.

Scanning around for this issue I found the "watch\_activations.py" script, and could trace what was happening to "osascript" running every minute. Some further looking and I could find that osascript was running an Apple Script from "Super Duper" to see if it was time to do a regularly scheduled backup. I guess if you schedule a backup to happen at, say, noon every day then there is a script being run \*every minute\* to see if it is noon and time to do the backup. Disabling the automatic backup cleared up the loss of focus issue in Xquartz.

I went to the developer of SuperDuper! about this, and his response was essentially that this is an Xquartz bug: "X11 shouldn't be surrendering focus to a headless app." At this point I can work around the issue by doing backups manually, fine, or find a different solution, but I really don't know enough to go further.

So I'm dutifully reporting the issue here in case it can be addressed by the XQuartz community, and also to share my experience in case there are others using SuperDuper! and having this issue. I'm running OS X 10.9.2, XQuartz 2.7.5, and SuperDuper! 2.7.2 (v92).

X11.app has no control over "surrendering focus". For example, the OS doesn't ask us "hey, do you want to let Mail.app take focus away from you?"

This is an OS bug.
