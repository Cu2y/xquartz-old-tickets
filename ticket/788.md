XQuartz does not support retina displays well
=============================================


I use Ghostscript to open \*.ps file, but it displays not well, even bad. I search the problem on the internet, and figure out that result from "XQuartz does not support retina displays well". But I don't know how to deal with this problem, please give a procedure step-by-step.
