Unmanaged windows are trimmed
=============================


Launching a remote (ssh) application that produces an unmanaged (no window decorations) on Snow Leopard 10.6.8, it is drawn centered and complete.
On Lion 10.7.2, it is displayed more to the right bottom of the screen and trimmed right and bottom.
Installing 2.6.3 on Lion 10.7.2 produces the same result.

The windows properties are:

    _MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO(_MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO) = 0x6c, 0x0, 0x5, 0xbf, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0xc3, 0xa, 0x10, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0
    WINDOW_ROLE(STRING) = "unnamed"
    WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW, WM_TAKE_FOCUS
    WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
                    Client accepts input or input focus: True
                    Initial state is Normal State.
    WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
                    user specified location: 353, 56
                    program specified location: 353, 56
                    user specified size: 1280 by 847
                    program specified size: 1280 by 847
                    program specified maximum size: 1280 by 1024
                    window gravity: NorthWest

Also happens with 2.7.0\_rc1. Screen capture attached.

It's placement is correct (353,56)

The requested size (1280x847) will not fit on your display.

What do you expect to happen?

can you provide a screenshot from the old case that you liked as well as its window properties

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/520#comment:3):

> can you provide a screenshot from the old case that you liked as well as its window properties

I'll get it and post it (I don't have access to the machine now).

The properties I posted previously were not taken from Mac OS running XQuartz. They were taken from X11 on Linux using xwininfo, where the window placement is ok, as previously on Snow Leopard 10.6.8.

I'm not sure how to take the window properties on Mac OS. Is xwininfo available as part of XQuartz?

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Nov 3, 2011](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/520#comment:5 "November 3, 2011 at 12:27 PM PDT")*

Yes, just use xwininfo. Please post the properties associate with each screenshot (good and bad)

Bad window properties (for the sreenshot already attached):
{{

I'm still trying to get the good one.

The good (same application launched from the same remote machine):

      Absolute upper-left X:  0
      Absolute upper-left Y:  0
      Relative upper-left X:  0
      Relative upper-left Y:  0

      Override Redirect State: yes
      Corners:  +0+0  -0+0  -0-0  +0-0
      -geometry 1280x778+0+0

I don't know why these values are different from the 'bad'. The only difference is the MAC OS version on which they are being sent to...

Should I gather some more information on this issue?

Sorry, I haven't had time to look into this.

That's ok.
I asked because I'll have access to the machines again today.

Hi Jeremy,

Any luck on this?

In the mean time, I've learned that on 17" displays it's working as expected. Only on smaller screens it doesn't work.

No, but it's on the list now...

Good, thanks!

Is there any push ($) we can do to have this fixed sooner?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*

Unfortunately not. As you probably know, XQuartz has essentially one primary developer (me), and I spend about only 5-10% of my development time on XQuartz. It's just a matter of time resources. The best contribution you could make would actually be development resources ... either providing a test case or digging in to the code to debug it and offer a patch =/

If that's something that you can do, I'll help out where I can, but this won't be fixed by me for a while just based on pure priorities and lack of a test case.

As an example, the improvements in GLX in 2.7.2 wouldn't've happened if Jonas didn't dive into the issue to fix his game from crashing. We didn't end up using exactly his fix, but he identified a workaround and that pointed to the root cause of the problem (which should be close to a final fix now). We really need to pull in more developers to help with these corner case issues.

I think this issue might be in quartz-wm, and that is OSS now (see [the wiki](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/quartz-wm))

Hi Jeremy,

Coming back to this bug as we'll probably have to try and fix it or sponsor a correction. Has there been further developments?

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Jun 7, 2013](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/520#comment:18 "June 7, 2013 at 2:14 PM PDT")*

Nope. Good luck finding someone to work on this. I'm sure there are plenty of students looking for work over summer break.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
