There is a problem with using xquartz with the practice room on my " my campustutors " account!
===============================================================================================


The video does not appear and the icons do not appear after installation of xquartz-2.7.5 on my macbook pro computer with " chrome " Browser!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

What video? What icons? This seems to have nothing to do with XQuartz.
