key mapping, in Wine games
==========================


In any Wine game I play... keys are not always exactly perfect (I have not tested in general X11 apps). The main problem is the ALT key never works. In an older 2.5.0 build I was using, my left and right alt would both work as button "3" In the current one I just installed off of Macports today (2/22/10), the left alt works as the space bar, and the right alt works as the 3 key. No key seems to map to alt, making every single game I use in Wine and Xquartz unable to have an Alt key at all. I've looked through xkb some, but I haven't figured out a way to remap the keys. This isn't a single game problem, well over 10 different games I've tested all work exactly the same.

This should be fixed with 2.5.0-rc1 when it's announced. Please verify with that release and reopen if you still have problems.
