X11 Windows not displaying on Mac secondary monitor
===================================================


I just upgraded to OS X Mavericks, I was forced to update with the latest version of XQuartz so that I can run a program on X11, I've already attempted to restart Wine, X11 & my Mac and it still doesn't work. What happens is I'm able to open the X11 window on my primary screen (Mac Book Pro), then I drag the window to the secondary monitor and the X11 window disappears, as I'm still actually dragging the window I can drag it back to the primary monitor and it reappears. It's weird. Any ideas?

Fixing this requires changes outside of XQuartz. Please file a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com>
