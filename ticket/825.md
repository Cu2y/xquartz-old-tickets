XQuartz.app doesn't launch via Launchpad/Finder - only via Terminal
===================================================================


I just installed XQuartz-2.7.5 on my system (Mac OS X 10.8.5) and tried to launch it via Launchpad or using Finder, and it doesn't start.

> Error message in system.log
>
>     Nov 17 22:10:28 macbook com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[229] ([0x0-0x42042].org.macosforge.xquartz.X11[1878]): Exited with code: 1

The strange thing: I can launch X11 via Terminal using either

    open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app

or

    startx

I have no idea why the launch via Doc fails, could you provide some ideas how to debug that?

meaning the launch via Launchpad/Finder fails - sorry for that

Please don't use startx directly.

'open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app' should do exactly the same thing as double clicking on it in Finder.

This smells like either user error or an Apple bug.

Can you show me more of what is in system.log before that exit line?

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/825#comment:2):

That's the only line related to XQuartz/X11.

In the meantime I tried to temp. remove my shell config files (.bash\*) - and now XQuartz.app starts just fine… So my bash config is messing things up:

-   .bashrc (<http://pastebin.com/YXv8TbxR>)
-   .bash\_profile (<http://pastebin.com/zzBZJJAt>)

Hm.. Do you have any idea why? Does X11 depends on some variables I set in my bash config files?

Looks like the execution of GNU screen in .bash\_profile is the problem:

    # run in screen
    if [ -z "$STY" ]
    then
            exec screen
    fi

When I remove it, XQuartz.app starts just fine. Maybe xterm is crashing when launching XQuartz.app with my bash configuration?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

Yeah, but I don't see why that would be different when double clicked versus launched via open.
