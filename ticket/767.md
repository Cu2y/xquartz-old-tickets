libpng15.15.dylib is malformed
==============================


If I try to change the id of `libpng.dylib` with `install_name_tool` (for example, when copying dylibs into an application bundle), it reports an error:

`    install_name_tool: for architecture i386 object: libpng.dylib malformed object (unknown load command 12)`

Minimal steps to reproduce this bug:
`    cp /opt/X11/lib/libpng.dylib ~`
`    install_name_tool -id myLibPng.dylib ~/libpng.dylib`

This does not occur with the libpng dylib from Homebrew, so I think it's a bug with the x11-libs version.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

No, it's fine. You just have an old install\_name\_tool that doesn't know about the LC\_DATA\_IN\_CODE load command.
