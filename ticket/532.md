After downgrading XQuartz.pkg, XQuartz.app remains the newer (undowngraded) version
===================================================================================


Happy new year to you all good folks.

Since the automatic upgrade to 2.7.1\_rc1, my MBP early 2011 downgraded to Snow Leopard has experienced continuous 1 second freezes for each action I'm doing.

-   Typing a mail: input freezes and then catches up.
-   Changing Space: Freezes at the last moment before the Spaces anchor on screen.
-   Quicktime playback: 1" hick-ups every few seconds.
-   Spotlight reindexed my whole drive without me asking for it

Checking on /Library/Receipts, XQuartz has been the only change in my system at the moment this disturbance has started to act up. I have not noted anything wrong on CPU usage nor any suspicious activity in the syslog.

I've tried to rollback to 2.7.0 but now X11 crashes because of a freetype dependency. See bellow.

Honestly, since I've rolled-back to 2.7.0, my Mac behaves normally. I keep my fingers crossed because I've got a lot of work to do this week. I'll keep you posted if the "1sec freezes occurs again".

My work relies heavily on X11. Hopefully, with Snow Leopard I can switch to using Apple X11 but I prefer Xquartz.

I hope you can identify what is what causes this disruption ...

... In the meantime, please repackage 2.7.0 to include the matching libfreetype dylib. I've read elsewhere that you've included a new freetype package in 2.7.1\_rc1. Rolling back to 2.7.0 is now impossible.

Thanks a lot,
Thierry

..... Few minutes later ....

Humm. Well, rolling back to 2.7.0 didn't solve my "freeze" problem. It has just started up again.

I'm going to load 2.7.1\_rc1 again.

Sorry for the scare :-{

Yeah, my guess is you have some DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH issues. What do these report:

    $ set | grep DYLD
    $ otool -L /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib

Please answer on the mailing list, since this doesn't seem like a real bug.

Thanks for checking into it,

Actually, as my MBP main "1 second freeze" problem of doesn't come from XQuartz, I loaded again 2.7.1\_rc1 again.

There is no "real bug" here then .... except the evidence of this new best practice:

> --&gt; If you put out for automatic update a RC (Release Candidate) DMG, please make sure that the previous Stable DMG can effectively be used to roll back to the last Stable version in case the RC version knows trouble.

As of now, it is not possible to rollback to any Stable release. Those that let the automatic updater install 2.7.1\_rc1 are stuck with it.

Again, I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Thierry

Ooops, I forgot ... but I've loaded 2.7.1\_rc1 again. So X11 is fine now.

I'm no longer in the situation where X11 crashed after I tried to rollback from 2.7.1\_rc1 to 2.7.0.

You can. Installing the 2.7.0 package over the 2.7.1\_rc1 will roll you back. There are also not that many changes in the 2.7.1\_rc.

That DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is the problem. I'll bet money you have a /usr/local/mysql/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib which reports itself as version 14.0.0

Don't set DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH unless you know what you're doing! Remove that variable from your environment, and you'll be fine.

Hello Jeremy, Thanks for the follow-up.

As of now, with 2.7.1\_rc1 re-loaded, I get this (see bellow). I don't know what files where copied over when I ran the 2.7.0 installer on top of the 2.7.1\_rc1.

From the CrashReporter report, it's stated that /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib is this copy of the offending lib file (*Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib*), and not one from another path .. as far as I understand how things work !

I definitely need that shared lib path envvar otherwise I can't get Perl MySQL DBD to load.

You are using DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to work around a bug, and it is causing other bugs. Don't use that variable unless you know what you are doing, and don'e accept it as a "fix" for anything.

This is not a bug in XQuartz.

Ok, it's not a bug in XQuartz, however, that shared lib path is required to let DBD MySQL reach the MySQL lib in the location it's set.

Then, 2.7.0 has perfectly worked since I installed it (or upgraded to) and with DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set. Same with any single versions for the past 8 years or so I've been using it.

2.7.1\_rc1 has worked and works again fine too, also with DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set.

However, my one attempt to downgrade from 2.7.1\_rc1 to 2.7.0 has failed.

I've always had a DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set with more path, for years, with other Macs under Tiger and Leopard when I was working with Tibco Rendez-Vous (/usr/tibco/lib). X11/XQuartz has always worked without any glitch.

Sorry for the burden.

Replying to [thierryv@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/532#comment:9):

> Ok, it's not a bug in XQuartz, however, that shared lib path is required to let DBD MySQL reach the MySQL lib in the location it's set.

It is not "required to let DBD MySQL reach the MySQL lib" ... Your /opt/perl/lib/site\_perl/5.12.4/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.bundle file is broken, and you're using DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to work around its brokenness. You should report this bug to whoever shipped you the broken /opt/perl/lib/site\_perl/5.12.4/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.bundle.

You can "fix" it yourself using install\_name\_tool. Don't use DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH unless you \*REALLY\* know what you're doing, and I think I can count the number of people I trust with DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH on one hand, and all of them work within 100 yards of my office. If someone tells you to use DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, tell them no. DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is only useful for developers when testing changes and not something for end users \*EVER\* ... It just masks real bugs and causes new ones. Do NOT USE IT!

> Then, 2.7.0 has perfectly worked since I installed it (or upgraded to) and with DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set. Same with any single versions for the past 8 years or so I've been using it.

You've been \*lucky\* in that your MySQL distribution installed either the same version of Freetype or newer than the one I shipped in XQuartz. But guess what. With this release, I installed a newer version of Freetype, and you're telling it to use an older version, and it can't use it.

> 2.7.1\_rc1 has worked and works again fine too, also with DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set.

Probably because you removed /usr/local/mysql/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib ... I notice from your 'find' above that it's no longer on your system.

> However, my one attempt to downgrade from 2.7.1\_rc1 to 2.7.0 has failed.

How?

> I've always had a DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set with more path, for years, with other Macs under Tiger and Leopard when I was working with Tibco Rendez-Vous (/usr/tibco/lib). X11/XQuartz has always worked without any glitch.

Then you've been \*LUCKY\*. Don't do it unless you know what you're doing, and if you do do it, don't report ANY bug to ANYONE until you verify that the problem still exists when you unset DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.

DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH forces applications to use different libraries than the ones intended.

> Sorry for the burden.

It's quite alright. This type of issue crops up every 3-6 months from users, and I really want to just get the word out. Somewhere, someone is telling people to use DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, and whoever is doing that needs to be corrected. You should pass this along to whomever pointed you to using DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

Interesting discussion.

I agree with you, resorting to using DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is not satisfying. Thanks to your help, I'll give a look into modifying the mysql.bundle to find by itself the MySQL lib files. Actually, I am not using the Apple supplied MySQL package but the Sun provided MySQL binary. I can't rely on Apple's unilateral decision to modify the Perl and MySQL binaries it supplies, I've compiled and installed my own Perl package, then, I'm installing whatever MySQL engine version I need for my work.

I'm more accustomed to using HPUX *chatr* command to fix shared lib path. I learn thanks to you that MacOSX also has its own utilities to fix shared lib look up path in binary files. I'll look to see if already when I build and compile Perl I should pass the /usr/local/mysql/lib path to the linker as compiled Perl CPAN modules recover that path set when the makefile is generated. Interesting investigation.

Then, for your own knowledge:

-   There is NO libfreetype packaged in the Sun MySQL DMG ! The last upgrade I did to my deployed MySQL is mysql-5.5.15-osx10.6-x86\_64.dmg. You can grab mysql-5.5.19-osx10.6-x86\_64.dmg from dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ See by yourself that the Sun MySQL package contains NO freetype dylib - no any other dylib whatsoever, in 5.5.15 and the latest 5.5.19

-   I performed the downgrade by simply running the 2.7.0 installer. I'm willing to give it a try and see how things turn out. I'm going to do that and let you know.

Hello again,

-   I have rolled back to 2.7.0 by just applying the 2.7.0 installer package found in XQuartz-2.7.0.dmg.

<!-- -->

-   I have removed the DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH export from my ~/.profile

And there is the exact same problem: Quartz doesn't load, with the same error.

    Dyld Error Message:
      Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib

      Reason: Incompatible library version: X11.bin requires version 15.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 14.0.0

I did a thorough search of possible conflicting libfreetype dylibs in my system and found this (2.7.0 still loaded) and got this below.

I am willing to leave 2.7.0 loaded for today only and use Snow Leopard's X11 in the meanwhile, if you need me to do more testing.

Best regards,
Thierry

Ok,

In the meantime, I've fixed the *mysql.bundle* binary created from the latest CPAN Module DBD-mysql-4.020.tar.gz

I no longer need to set a DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to fix this. I shall report it to the maintainer of that module ... if it helps: The information collected from *mysql\_config* are not taken into account.

Thanks for educating me on this.

Your most recent info shows that /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin wants version 15, but /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib is version 14. That is in contrast to your earlier report which showed /opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib as version 15.

It looks like /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin is from 2.7.1\_rc\* but /opt/X11/lib is 2.7.0

Can you provide your /var/log/install.log?

Here it is.

Auto update occurred on Dec 30. I tried to "roll back" on Jan 3 when I suspected XQuartz upgrade caused the "1 sec freezes" of my MBP (still not resolved as of today).

Hello,

I have reinstalled 2.7.1\_rc1, using the posted DMG. Indeed, X11.bin is identical. It means that running the 2.7.0 installer "missed" installing that file.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.7.1* to *OSX*

This is a bug in Package Maker.app ... XQuartz.app is marked as downgradeable in the pmdoc, but packagemaker is not creating a package which lets it downgrade. This is not an XQuartz bug.
