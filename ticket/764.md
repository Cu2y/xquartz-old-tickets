XQuartz =&gt; CentOS 6.4 XDMCP fails BadMatch
=============================================


SUMMARY

XQuartz fails while bringing up login screen from CentOS 6.4 box.
Starts to come up, but then crashes with

> X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
>
> > Major opcode of failed request: 73 (X\_GetImage)
> > Serial number of failed request: 1394
> > Current serial number in output stream: 1394

This works fine when coming in from another CentOS linux box instead
of Mac OS X box.

Q: Any logging information I can provide?
Q: Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Michael

DETAIL

I have just installed XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0) on OS X
10.8.4 (12E55) in order to have a remote desktop to a CentOS 6.4 box.

I am doing the following:

launch XQuartz
observe local xterm
$ ssh -X -C username@centos64

$ echo $DISPLAY
localhost:10.0
$ gnome-terminal&
\# successfully launches terminal session with window on Mac

$ firefox&
\# successfully launches browser with window on Mac

$ Xnest -query localhost -geometry 1024x768 :1
\# starts to come up
\# I can see window with proper background
\# then fails

This exact same sequence works fine if I go from another linux box
instead of from Mac.

Looks like [\#⁠501](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/501)

Can you please provide the crash log?
