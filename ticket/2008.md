x windows can't move into part of the screen
============================================


I have a laptop and external display to the left of it, and I noticed after upgrading to 2.7.7 a new X Window would appear in the lower portion of the screen. Attempts to resize it or drag it into the upper portion fail, on either screen, it can't go above some invisible line (but dragging between screens works fine). I had “Displays have separate Spaces” turned on, and I read bug <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1876> so I turned it off, and it fixed the problem.

I'm also running 10.9.4.

The issue is that your two X11 displays are not connected... hmm...

Having the same problem with the same setup. Prior to 2.7.7, the "invisible barrier" only existed on my laptop screen. After upgrading, it's on both!

Yeah, the menu bars are excluded... We'll need to detect this type of layout somehow and include the menu bars anyways.

Experiencing this issue as well. It occurs periodically when reattaching the external monitor after the laptop has been disconnected and gone in to sleep mode. I've tried changing the screen resolution while xQuartz is running and when not. It correct where it thinks the top and bottom of the screen is. The misplacement seems to be offset from actual vertically at about 1/2 the screens height - such that the top of displayed windows starts midway up the screen and the bottom is some equal distance below the actual screen. Only reboot seems to clear the condition - which is often a painful disruption. Is there some config file that controls this that I can nuke when this occurs to get the app to reassess where the screen really is as a workaround? Thanks.

This is typo. Apologies. It should read "It doesn't correct where it thinks the top and bottom of the screen is."

I have the same problem.

Switching off “Displays have separate Spaces”.

I think that this issue was address in 2.7.8. Please comment and reopen if it is still an issue.
