X11.app doesn't support multiple users via fast-user switching
==============================================================


Begin using X11 apps in one user and leave running (eg, glxgears). Via fast-user switching, switch to another user. Now attempt to run an X11 application. X11 will fail to start. Errors in the logs indicate that it is trying to access the other user's xserver and is being properly denied.

What should happen is a new instance of the xserver should be started for the second user that is separate and independent of the first user's xserver.

This worked as expected in the original Leopard release of X11 (2.0). It fails to work for multiple users in the X11-2.1.0.1 and X11-2.1.1 packages (I don't have a way to test the earlier version.

Also, when trying to start X11 in the second user, launchd goes into an infinite loop trying to continuously start X11, even after control-C was issued in the Terminal trying to start the application. The only solution to terminate the loop was to log the user out entirely.

In my test case, user 501 was the initial user to start X11. user 502 then tried to start it with the following showing up in the system log repeatedly:

-   **Type** changed from *crash* to *usability*
-   **Version** set to *2.1.1 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Keywords** *regression* added
-   **Priority** changed from *minor* to *major*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.2.0*

This is a regression from Leopard's stock X11 and should be fixed ASAP. The problem exists in 2.1.1, but since then we've moved over to xinit/startx to start the server, so the necessary changes should go into xinit.c now.

Merle, I can't actually reproduce this on my system -- I was able to log two users in without any strange behavior.

Would you please copy the attached file to /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11, and then reproduce the problem and check Console.app for debug messages from X11? Hopefully that will give me enough info to solve the problem....

With the current (xinit-based) startup, this is definitely a problem (I wouldn't expect it to be working since I didn't add anything yet to work around it). When starting from a second account, I get the following:

We just need to add logic to xinit.c to intelligently choose the next available display... or just avoid using the standard unix display sockets entirely (why should we be using them anyway).

Ben,

When I made sure it was a reproduceable problem, I did a erase and install from the Leopard release DVD (in this case it was the one in the Developer mailing). I did exclude all printers except HP and Guttenprint as I only have HP printers and excluded all the additional languages and fonts). That got me a clean 10.5.0 with only the first admin user (I did not migrate any users, settings or apps). Then I installed Xcode from the DVD. Finally, I installed all the updates via software update which gave me a clean Leopard at 10.5.1.

I then added a new non-admin user and verified that I could utilize X11 from both users simultaneously.

I shut down X11 in both users and logged the second user out. At that point I installed the X11-2.1.1 package from the xquartz.macosforge.org site. This requires a reboot.

Log back in and fire up X11 in the admin account. Then fast-user switch to the second user and attempt to run an X11 requiring app and X11 is unable to launch.

I've been able to reproduce it at will with this procedure and on two different machines, a Intel Mac Pro and a PPC PowerBook G4.

Merle

Gaak! I never meant to suggest that your problem wasn't reproducible, merely that I couldn't figure out how to do it, which makes it more difficult for me to debug.

On my G5, I ran oclock under my main account "bbyer", then switched to another user account "local" and ran oclock again. After doing that, this is what PS shows:

It's possible I may have "accidentally" fixed this bug on this machine, so I'll try wiping out the X11 install on it and reinstalling using your steps.

One last thing to check: What does "echo $DISPLAY" report for each user account?

DISPLAY in both accounts is /tmp/launch-xxxxxx/:0 under the default Leopard X11 install which works (would have been really nice if the user that gets non-:0 would have had their display updated as it is real hard to figure out what display number is really being used) and under X11-2.1.1 which doesn't work it is also /tmp/launch-xxxxxx/:0.

So, it would appear that the default Leopard X11 was in this situation ignoring the :0 in DISPLAY and just using the socket? and X11-2.1.1 isn't? (I'm guess I'm being way to simplistic in my thinking here)

Merle, I think you might be confused about something...

/tmp/launch-xxxxxx/:0 is the socket. /tmp/launch-xxxxxx is a directory, and in that directory is one file named ':0'. That file is a socket.

*merlereinhart@…* commented *[on Dec 21, 2007](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/34#comment:12 "December 21, 2007 at 4:41 PM PST")*

Maybe. I was thinking about the DISPLAY environment variable which points at the socket and I think I was confusing myself with the 'other' socket in /tmp/.X11-unix (and corresponding /tmp/.Xn-lock file).

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on Dec 21, 2007](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/34#comment:13 "December 21, 2007 at 5:35 PM PST")*

Yeah, if DISPLAY begins with "/tmp/launchd-", then it is treated as a full path to the socket. If it begins with "unix:" or just ":", then what follows the : is the display number. The :0 filename of our launchd socket was chosen to make the formatting more traditional but it doesn't actually mean anything special as far as the display number.

Just to confirm -- the xxxxx is different between the two accounts, right? I can't figure out how the second user is even seeing the first user's socket to try to connect to it, unless they're actually using :0 instead of the launchd socket.

If the two $DISPLAY values are different, can you try looking at them with 'ls' from both users? Your user [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2) should not be able to see the file pointed at by user [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1)'s $DISPLAY.

When I run '$ ls -l /tmp/launch-\*', I get (among other entries)

    /tmp/launch-dW7Olw:
    total 0
    srwx------  1 bbyer  wheel  0 Dec 20 03:15 :0

    /tmp/launch-dYBxdc:
    ls: launch-dYBxdc: Permission denied

Here, my user [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2)'s DISPLAY was /tmp/launch-dYBxdc. As you can see, I shouldn't even be able to connect to that socket enough to be denied by the xauth scheme.

Actually... I find this message in your log suspicious:
2/21/07 7:00:02 AM org.x.X11\[723\] \_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0,directory /tmp/.X11-unix will not be created.

Does that directory exist for you? I don't get that error, but I can't figure out where the code is actually making that directory...

So, I just had the, uh, opportunity to reinstall Leopard from scratch, and with it I installed X11 2.1.1 from this site. Now, I can reproduce the problem perfectly. And it's really stupid. :(

Setting blocker since I don't want to release a new version without this fixed.

I hack-fixed this in the following commit:

<http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/app/xinit.git;a=commit;h=0f740f75ececc9742c6f407d53b482897ef5f698>

It just picks a display based on a missing /tmp/.X??-lock. If this doesn't get "properly" fixed in the next week, I'll push out 2.1.2 with this hack-fix since it's still better than what we have in 2.1.1.

Go for it -- that's roughly equivalent to what I'm doing upstream (just looking for the presence of the socket file, and not trying to connect to it -- instead, just picking the next one).

Doing this correctly is hard, and the potential benefit of properly reaping stale sockets is marginal (esp compared to the risk of causing bugs like this).

Ship it!

-   **Priority** changed from *blocker* to *critical*

There is one problem with it though which really should be addressed... we need a way to clean up stale lock files... also, I ran into a weird issue where quartz-wm won't start unless tcpip is enabled when there are stale lock files present. quartz-wm is started in xinitrc which has the unix socket DISPLAY rather than the launchd DISPLAY, but I'm still not sure why that'd be causing a problem... I'm thinking that the launchd socket might be affiliated with one of the older stale unix sockets and thus quartz-wm is starting on one and xterm is starting on another... but that problem is easily worked around (claning out /var/tmp) and it works better than the current release...
