Some accented characters with greek language are (still) not there
==================================================================


Since I can't seem to reopen the bug report [\#⁠36](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/36), I have to write a new one.

First of all, from all the greek community, A BIG THANK YOU :)
We were really missing greek keyboard layout. Indeed the bug has been fixed.

Keyboard layout works mostly as expected and

1) Keyboard change: works

2) `[accent]` followed by `[letter]` : works

3) `[SHIFT]+[accent]` followd by `[letter]` : works

Still, there is one minor problem pending, so I reopen this bug.

With greek keyboard enabled, when I press `[OPT]+[;]` followed by `[i]` *or* `[OPT]+[;]` followed by `[u]` instead of getting ΐ or ΰ , I get ΅ι or ΅υ

This is not a common combination in modern greek, but it is there.

To help you understand why this bug is there, originally in X11 layout, to get the same character we use `[;]` followed by `[SHIFT]+[;]` followed by `[i]` - or `[u]`. This is a multi-combination character.

In Mac OSX though, instead of `[;]...[SHIFT]+[;]` we have to use `[OPT]+[;]`

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.0*

I must reveal my ignorance here in i18n ... what is the name of the ΅ symbol? That will help me find the right dead key to assign to that keycode.

This character:

Hope this helps

Or this... I am not sure which is the correct one
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0344/index.htm>

Actually is "diairesis" ("dialytika) with "accent" ("tonos") together.

Ok, right now with 2.3.3-beta1, if i do shift-;, i, I get ϊ in both X11 and TextEdit. This is also consistent with what I see as the keyboard mapping if I choose "Greek" in Fedora 10. Here's the xev output:

Looking at opt-;,&lt;space&gt; in TextEdit, it produces UTF8 0xce85 (<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0385/index.htm>)

opt-; in X11 produces a Greek\_accentdieresis ... There doesn't seem to be an X11 keysym for a deadkey version of that symbol...

I'm not sure I can fix this "the right way"

the odd thing is that if you notice ΐ is produced with for shift-; followed by i. ϊ is not produced.

"if i do shift-;, i, I get ϊ in both X11 and TextEdit"

Yes, that's right, that's why I wrote above that "\[SHIFT\]+\[accent\] followed by \[letter\] : works "

About the X11 keysym for a deadkey version of ΅ - yes, as far as I know such a deadkey does not exist; I remember this from the days we were trying to fix exactly the same thing with main Xorg/XFree86 tree.
In X11 though multi-key combinations are present, so the problem was easily solved. It is the "\[;\]...\[SHIFT\]+\[;\]" combibation I was talking about.

I am almost sure that there is a need for patch - probably specific to mac. \[OPT\]+\[;\]..\[i\]/\[u\] is not a combination that could be found somewhere else. Maybe create a new "deadkey" or multi-key cobination? (I don't remember the actual term, but I remember that you can create custom combinations if you please)

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.3.3* to *2.4.0*

Yeah, this will require a new dead key to support. I'm bumping this for later since I want to get out 2.3.3 and I'm not entirely sure how to go about this. I'll need to do some digging.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
