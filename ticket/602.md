I just upgraded to Mt Lion, then downloaded XQuartz 2.7.2 to run WordSearx SW
=============================================================================


Before I downloaded XQuartz, got message that I needed the X11 application.
After I downloaded XQuartz, the WordSearch SW responds, but goes into immediate shutdown.
Any suggestions will be appreciated

I have not idea what WordSearh is, but this is not (or does not appear to be) a bug in XQuartz.

Do you have a crash log?

What shuts down?

Have you contacted the makers of WordSearch?
