New Mac Update- XQuartz no longer works
=======================================


Hi,
After my computer installed new updates, my XQuartz no longer works. I uninstalled and reinstalled but this did not help.

I am using Mac OS X 10.8.2.

When trying to open XQuartz, I get the following error:

Dyld Error Message:

> Library not loaded: /opt/X11/\*/libfreetype.6.dylib
> Referenced from: /opt/X11/\*/libXfont.1.dylib
> Reason: Incompatible library version: libXfont.1.dylib requires version 15.0.0 or later, but libfreetype.6.dylib provides version 13.0.0

Thanks,
Missy

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

/opt/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib is definitely version 15.

You have probably set the DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable without really understanding its implications.
