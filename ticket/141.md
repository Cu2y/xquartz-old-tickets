Release 2.3.0 does not work properly with Wacom graphics tablet
===============================================================


When using a mouse, release 2.3.0 works as expected.

However, if you have a Wacom Graphics Tablet attached, and you use the pen and tablet in place of the mouse, various window functionality is broken for X11 windows:

-   windows cannot be moved by their title bars

<!-- -->

-   the "traffic lights" to close, iconize and maximize the window do not respond to clicks

<!-- -->

-   clicking on a window does not bring it to the front

<!-- -->

-   windows cannot be resized using the drag box at bottom right

In short, it seems that pen clicks are being ignored, or at least, not being treated in the same way as mouse clicks, contrary to the behaviour in all other software.

This makes X11 applications unusable if you use a tablet as your main input device, in place of a mouse (e.g. because of a disability).
