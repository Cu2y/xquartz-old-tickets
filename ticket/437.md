RandR not working right on 10.5
===============================


RANDR in development in 2.6.0 is not working right in Mac OS X 10.5.

With a single monitor xrandr says
"xrandr: could not get screen resources"

with dual monitors it will show 2 screen sizes, for the full desktop size with and without the top bar space.

builds for 10.6 seem to work fine. I have not tested 10.4.

Additional Info.. It doesn't appear to be working in 2.5.3 either w/ Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a).

bash-3.2$ xrandr
Xlib: extension "RANDR" missing on display "/tmp/launch-E9sgLX/:0".
RandR extension missing

Unless there is something additional that must be done to enable RandR...

RANDR is not available in 2.5.3. That is expected. It is new to 2.6.0

Ok, I was confused by this page <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.5.3>

It talks about xrandr 1.3.3 interface fixes, so I assumed it was supported on the server.

I'll wait for 2.6.0, thx.

Yes, the xrandr client application has been shipping, but the server hasn't been supporting the RANDR extension until recently.

Just a question since its partly to do with this ticket... and maybe worth considering while fixing the issue...

In multi-monitor mode when it does work, it only picks up the combined resolution... is that all it will ever do? If someone has 2+ Monitors RandR really can't do much for them with multiple resolutions. I know you said you were going to set up the fullscreen modes to capture the Display's (which should fix the fullscreen focus loss bug too), but would that be able to capture just 1 display (primary) instead of all, and have Xquartz only see the 1 screen as active and have all RandR options available with the other monitor ignored? This of course would have to be a setting that could be changed... or should I ad in a new ticket for requesting Display Capturing for fullscreen and gaming mode.

See xquartz-dev for discussion about plans regarding this.

That's pretty much where I'm aiming is to just use the primary display.
