X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
==================================================================================


usage of wine to run a opengl application leads to:

X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)

> Major opcode of failed request: 128 (Apple-DRI)
> Minor opcode of failed request: 2 ()
> Value in failed request: 0x3f
> Serial number of failed request: 17
> Current serial number in output stream: 17

this can be reproduced from Mac OS X 10.4.x - Mac OS X 10.5.2
note, on leopard usage of DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH is needed to get "this far" because of a linker bug.
