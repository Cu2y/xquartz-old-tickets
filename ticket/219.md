Window minimization issue in full-screen mode
=============================================


With X11 set for full-screen mode but not open, I type xeyes in Terminal. I get the xeyes window in front of the root window, as I expect. I click the yellow traffic light---I'm using quartz-wm---on the xeyes window. Nothing happens, but if I follow with cmd-opt-a I get to my Desktop with the xeyes window minimized to an icon on my dock. I click that icon and I'm taken back to the root window, but no eyes! Need to do cmd-opt-a twice to correct things. I guess this is a minor issue, but I'd expect to see the xeyes window after clicking on that dock icon.

This seems to occur using Tiger's X11 under Leopard as well... how did this behave on Tiger?

This has been the behavior since (atleast) Tiger. Yes, it's sub-optimal, but quartz-wm is designed for rootless. Fullscreen is designed for other WMs.
