Having the same problem as ticket 643
=====================================


<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/643>

I'm a student at UCDavis. I upgraded my OS on my MAC recently, and to my surprise, they removed X11. So I downloaded the latest XQuartz recommended to me by apple. How was ticket 643 resolved? Funny thing is only one window acts funny, the rest of the screens load just

it would be nice to have this bug fixed.
