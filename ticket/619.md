ssh -X not working
==================


Hi I'm just try to use ssh -X to forwarding the remote server (ubuntu) and display the GUI on my Mac (mountain lion). Since X11 is not built in Mountain Lion. I download XQuartz.

After checking the setting, I changed /etc/ssh\_config

> \# ForwardX11 yes

and /etc/sshd\_config

> X11Forwarding yes
> X11DisplayOffset 10

But it still not working.

I'm quite overhead

Thanks!
