Won't start when a user is managed (Parental Controls)
======================================================


When a user account is managed, XQuartz won't start up!

Note:

1.  XQuartz is enabled (checked) in the "parental controls" pane of a student user's Accounts Preferences window.

<!-- -->

1.  A dialog is displayed when XQuartz is started where an admin user should be able to override the "parental controls" but the override fails!

I need to use X11 in a student iMac lab and must enable "parental controls" to manage student user accounts.

The iMacs are running Snow Leopard 10.6.4 and are "new" (installed summer 2010).

What happens? See anything in /var/log/system.log?

Funny that you just closed this, because I just ran into the issue yesterday at a school I'm working with.

Here is the console output you need.

    5/20/11 1:46:28 PM [0x0-0x7ed7ed].org.macosforge.xquartz.X11[86146]    -: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin: Permission denied

To test I just created a new account, "student", applied parental controls, but allow XQuartz and X11 as applications. When I start XQuartz I'm asked to authenticate if I want to \[Always Allow\] \[Allow Once\] \[Cancel\]. I try authenticating with my admin password, but that fails.

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Important*
-   **Component** changed from *X11.pkg* to *xserver*
-   **Milestone** changed from *2.7.0* to *OSX*

I suspect this is an issue in OSX, but hopefully I'll be able to find a workaround.

I have the same problem with OSX 10.8 and XQuartz 2.7.2 (xorg-server 1.12.2).

Same problem here. I am running 10.8 with XQuartz 2.7.2. Of interest, if I select the "allow once" option,
it seems to work fine. If I select the "allow always" option, the authorization fails and it sends you back to the original authorization prompt.

If anyone finds a work-around, I would be very interested in it.

Mike

Thanks Mike. Using "allow once" worked for me as well, though it asks for permissions for other apps. Only the X11 app needs "allow once" and all others can be "allow always".

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
