Xquartz vs. launchd and DirectoryServices and setting the login shell....
=========================================================================


It seems that Xquartz cannot see the user's *\_current\_* login shell upon startup, unlike Terminal which can see login shell changes *immediately* (i.e. immediately after running "chsh" or changing the shell in the user's Advanced options preferences, and then opening another tab in the running Terminal application -- it will get the new shell).

Xquartz requires a complete system restart before it will use a user's new login shell (even logging out is insufficient). This is absurd.

This is true in at least 2.7.4 and 2.7.5, running on 10.6 through 10.9, and perhaps much earlier too.

This seems to have caused enormous confusion and doubt in users for years now. I see posts in the X11-users archives going back to 2009 with people not understanding that the issue has to do with the inadequate way launchd reloads changed values and the resulting way that Xquartz fails to compensate in the same way Terminal must be doing. The confusion gets so bad that people blame tools like "chsh", which are most definitely not to blame in any way.

It confused the heck out of me too until I finally read that Xquartz is inheriting $SHELL from launchd instead of learning it properly from DirectoryServices \[i.e. using getpwuid(getuid())\].

I'm not sure if the X11 wrapper script (around $X11.bin) is really doing anything useful at all -- it just seems to add an enormous layer of confusion. It's never ever been something needed in any traditional X11 environments, no matter how the server has been started. On osx the user's shell is specified in DirectoryServices, and it should not be duplicated anywhere else. Every other environment setting can, and *should* be set after X11 starts, regardless of what window manager or other application the user might be using.

-   **Resolution** set to *wontfix*

Yes, XQuartz inherits it from launchd via $SHELL. If you want to do something special, that's what ~/.x11run is for.
