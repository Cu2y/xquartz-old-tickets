Ok, then if you can answer the questions in that ticket, there may be a chance that someone can fix this at some point.

How to i do that? Install each and any XQuarz Version and test NX???
I also have a message in the terminal that says "error: xp\_attach\_gl\_context returned 2"
if i "Google" it i get this Ticket [\#⁠503](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/503) or [\#⁠512](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/512) or [\#⁠536](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/536)

Our case its that a second OGL window is opened.
I think the error is because a second OGL window is opened.
And this chause a error after the second OGL window is closed.
