Spaces & X11 worse with 2.1.0.pkg?
==================================


The changelog says 'Improved compatibility with Spaces'. What does this really mean?

With 2.1.0.pkg, Spaces is jumping around on me when I moved the mouse to about ~100 pixels from the top of the screen to other random spaces--even though I have X11 screens in just one space.

It got so aggravating that I had to turn Spaces off.

Am I missing something?

Forgot to mention this doesn't quite happen every time. It might be my imagination, but it seemed to get worse over the few hours since I installed and started using 2.1.0.

-   **Resolution** set to *duplicate*

It has "improved" support for spaces. There are still outstanding issues. See ticket [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2) <http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/ticket/2>
