Opening windows by X in Mavericks GM when using dual monitors
=============================================================


Hello.

I'm currently using Mavericks GM version.
When I try to open a window via X forwarding in dual monitors status,
the forwarded windows are gone to somewhere out from the current monitor.
So, I can't access to it simply because my mouse pointer can't reach to it.

Do you have any idea for this?
