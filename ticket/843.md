Disk C:
=======


After installing XQuartz the software i'm trying to use asks for the C: disk that does not exist.
No way to make a new folder or so?

Ask for support for the software you're using. That is not something relevant to XQuartz.

The software works on X11 on older OS but on XQuartz can't find a C: Disk or any writable folder....
Do i still have to ask to the sw support?

Yes. As there is no such thing as "C:" on OS X, my guess is you are using wine, and you have not configured it properly. That has nothing to do with XQuartz.
