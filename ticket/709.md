missing header files
====================


I was trying to compile xv-3.10a and I can't do it because there seem to be many missing header files such as Xlib.h, Xos.h, Xutil.h, Xosdefs.h, Xfuncproto.h, and Xarch.h. Is there any chance that these files will be added to XQuartz sometime?

They are most certainly present. You should set PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH to include /opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig and /opt/X11/share/pkgconfig
