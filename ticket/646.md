Unable to Download 2.7.3 with Safari and Mountain Lion
======================================================


I just switched to the Mountain Lion OS on my Mac.

I am trying to download and keep getting the error message:

**Users/DalesMac/Downloads could not be saved, because an unknown error occurred.
**

Try saving to a different location.**
