changing X11 Preferences causes cut&paste problems
==================================================


Intel Mac running OSX 10.5.7 (German) and XQuartz 2.3.3.2 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple42):

Cut & Paste between OSX und X11 apps doesn't work after changing any X11 preference. The contents of org.x.X11.plist in this case is expanded with values for the properties sync\_pasteboard\* and sync\_clibpoard\*, all set to boolean "no".

Deleting org.x.X11.plist (and loosing all changes) seems to be the only way to get c&p work again between OSX and X11 apps.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

This is a localization problem, unfortunately... the locales have been updated and will be included in the next release.

Can you test out these locales for me:

Just install this package after installing 2.3.3.2.

Thanks,
