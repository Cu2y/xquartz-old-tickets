Tab and Esc keys mapping troubles
=================================


Hi,
I recently upgraded my PowerMac to 10.5.3 Mac os X server and installed the latest version of Xquartz (2.2.1). Compared X11 I used to use on the 10.4 Mac os x server distribution, I have a major problem. The &lt;tab&gt; and &lt;esc&gt; keys are not mapped correctly on my (standard international English Mac) keybord. To obtain the &lt;tab&gt; key I have to type &lt;shift&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; and I cannot figure out how to get the true &lt;esc&gt; key. Is this feature/bug known and how do I work around it?
Cheers
Massimo

I am certainly not experiencing this proble. If I open up xterm, tab completion works as expected. tab is inserted correctly in my editors... I think this may be the stuck modifier key problem rather than a bad mapping. Can you please close and restart X11 and try it fresh. Do not change spaces or do anything else that requires the modifier keys.

Actually, I see nothing of that sort on another machine running Mac OS X 10.5.3. But the problem persists on a MAC OS X server 10.5.3. I tried already what you suggested, but it did not do any good. I found a fix, but I can't understand why it works. The fix is to clear mod1 and mod2 with xmodmap. Frankly, I don't know why and where they are set originally to:

mod1 Mode\_switch (0x42), Mode\_switch (0x45)
mod2 Meta\_L (0x3f), Meta\_R (0x47)

But now I have got another problem!! The key "\`" switches me from one X11 session to the other. Please note, that I have got this problem only on the Leopard server.

Thank for taking your time to answer
Massimo

Yeah, this really seems like you have a stuck modifier key. There should be no difference at all between the normal and server versions of OSX with respect to X11.
