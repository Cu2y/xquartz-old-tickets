MIDI does not appear to be working
==================================


I've been trying to use XQuartz for a few different MIDI applications (VFX and Wine), and have so far failed to be able to get any of them to work. I've also downgraded to 2.2.0 and still am unable to get it to work (although it did come to life for a brief moment at one point).

I should also point out that I'm using the defalt Audio/MIDI configuration and everything works fine with Logic Audio on the OSX side of the fence.

X11 has nothing to do with audio.
