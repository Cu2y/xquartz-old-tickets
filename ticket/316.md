Root window obscures all other windows, sometimes
=================================================


When I launch `openbox-session` from my .xinitrc, Openbox's root window obscures any other window. According to `top`, hitting command-N to spawn a new xterm technically works, but it's impossible to actually see the new xterm. This is all under full-screen mode.

If I then disable full-screen mode, Openbox's root window disappears as expected, but the xterms I spawned still are not visible. Hitting command-N at this point still creates new, invisible xterms.

On a possibly related note, I cannot command-click/right click on OpenBox's root window to get the Openbox menu, either. And quitting XQuartz does not kill the `openbox` process, I have to kill it myself.

The weird thing is that all of this used to work before -- with OS X 10.5.2's shipment of X11, if I remember correctly.

Here's the result of `xwininfo -all -root` with `openbox-session` running. It might be of interest.

    xwininfo: Window id: 0x1fb (the root window) (has no name)

      Root window id: 0x1fb (the root window) (has no name)

      Someone wants these events:
          ButtonPress
          ButtonRelease
          EnterWindow
          LeaveWindow
          StructureNotify
          SubstructureRedirect
          FocusChange
          PropertyChange
      Do not propagate these events:
      Override redirection?: No

      No window manager hints defined

      No normal window size hints defined
      No zoom window size hints defined

      No window shape defined
      No border shape defined

By the way, I compiled Openbox 3.4.5 with MacPorts.

Oh and I'm convinced it's not Openbox's or MacPorts' issue because I see similar behavior when trying to run Xfce. And I should mention that the `openbox` process that won't terminate eats up 99% of my CPU.

Is this still a problem with 2.5.0? The code setting up window levels was changed a while ago.

Also, if openbox is eating up 99% CPU, then that is certainly not an issue with X11.app.

Nope, it's working fine now. Thanks
