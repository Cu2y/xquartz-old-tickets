xterm background not always redrawn
===================================


While trying to diagnose lost modifier keys in xmonad running rootless, I restarted it which causes windows to have their borderWidth set to 0 and then 2. xterm does not reliably repaint its background in this case; sometimes it ends up all white and I have to do something that updates the background ("clear", scrolling, etc.). I am trying to come up with a set of conditions under which this failure is repeatable.

Have y ou been able to come up with reproduction steps? Does this still happen with recent versions? Have you seen it in other applications or reached out to xterm's developer?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
