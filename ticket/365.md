new windows created with titlebar offscreen, and focus problems
===============================================================


Since updating to 2.5.0 RC2, I'm having intermittent problems. The first time was right after updating from RC1 - when XQuartz restarted after the update, the titlebar of the startup xterm was obscured by the main menubar. I logged out and back in, and it seemed to work fine after that, until today.

This morning I was working on a variety of tasks using xterms on the local machine as well as some coming through ssh from other machines. I put the machine to sleep (it's a macbook), and returned to it this afternoon. After waking the machine, sometimes (about once in 4 attempts) when I created a new xterm (either through the XQuartz Applications menu or firing one up using ssh -fY to another host) it too would be created with the top of the window under the menu bar, meaning I couldn't move it. Also, some windows didn't have normal focussing behaviour - when I clicked into the xterm, the titlebar would look like focus didn't transfer - the controls at the top left stayed greyed out instead of changing to red, yellow and green, and when I typed into the window, it looked like nothing was happening, but if I pressed Return, the command that I typed would execute.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to reproduce this again yet. This last time, I quit XQuartz, restarted it, and everything worked fine. Thinking that it might have to do with putting the machine to sleep and then waking it (perhaps as a specific case of a display configuration "change"?), but I just tried that and this time everything's still working fine.

If I manage to reproduce again, I'll report back in - is there anything else I should do?

Now, just after submitting, I have an xterm on the screen that appears to take focus in that when I click on it the titlebar changes appropriately, but when I type into the window, the text is invisible until I press return. Furthermore, I can't move the window - clicking and dragging the titlebar has no effect. There is only one other xterm running, and it's behaving normally.

This is fixed in git. You can use this server binary if you want to have the fix now:
