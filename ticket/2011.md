XQuartz UI fight for pointer control
====================================


When running virt-manager on XQuartz, I find that virt-manager is able to get control of the pointer in two ways. First, it's able to make the pointer disappear and be locked into a particular window. This disallows me to use the rest of the Mac OS UI during this time. I know that the UI provided by virt-manager ideally lets me restore control, but this state is a pretty dangerous one and if not all elements are successfully returned to their normal state, the only option might be a total machine reboot (for example if remote access is disabled). I'd like this to be overridable such that a Command-Tab may universally switch out of XQuartz, or that there be an XQuartz-specific release key sequence.

The second thing that virt-manager is able to do (for example) is to constantly shift the pointer so that it appears to be within the same window. I end up fighting the pointer because of this. I wish at those times to select a menu option in that window or otherwise to quit XQuartz. But my pointer races back to the window. I'd like for XQuartz to allow for user overrides or I'd like to be able to specify a level of control around this.

There are not XQuartz bugs. These are client bugs. Please file tickets with virt-manager developers.
