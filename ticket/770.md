X11 window resizing/scaling
===========================


Adaptive scaling when resizing the X11 terminal window doesn't work.

The area used to display content inside the window remains the same if the window size is either increased or decreased. Say my default window size at launch is 100x30. If I then resize to 200x50, the text displayed within the window remains limited to 100x30.
