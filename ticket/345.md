2.4 doesn't seem to work on my leopard
======================================


I am a new MacBook Pro user. The OS I use is Mac OS X 10.6.2.
I downloaded the X11 2.4.0 and when I try to install it, it says "Leopard Only This update is designed for OSX Leopard Only". I tried to install the previous version but the result was the same. How can I install it?
Thanks!

As mentioned, those are only for Leopard. They're not supposed to install on SnowLeopard.

Use X11 shipped with SnowLeopard, use xorg-server from MacPorts, use the latest 2.5.0 beta for SnowLeopard, or wait for 2.5.0 to ship.
