Corrupt Display Running xeyes On Mac OS X 10.8
==============================================


The xeyes display is corrupt when running the application with Xquartz on Mac OS X 10.8.2 and 10.8.3.

To reproduce the problem, start xeyes either locally on a Mac or on a Linux system and display back to the Xquartz X11 server running on the Mac. Move and resize the xeyes window and eventually the display is corrupted and xeyes needs to be restarted to correct the display.

Any idea when someone will take a look at this problem?

Can you try reproducing it?

Thanks.

This problem continues to occur after upgrading to Mac OS X 10.8.4.

Well, this problem continues with Mac OS X 10.8.5. I am not one for sarcasm, but thanks for the fine support. Not even so much as an acknowledgement that I reported this problem. Real nice and very classy! (more sarcasm).

There isn't really anybody working on XQuartz at the level to diagnose and fix the issue you are reporting.

For what it is worth, I found that running xeyes with the +shape command option avoids the display corruption. But the background is white instead of transparent. This occurs running xeyes locally on a Mac or remotely on a Linux systems.

Running xeyes with -shape (the default) and getting display corruption may not be as benign as I originally thought. On two separate occasions I have repeatedly run xeyes with -shape as tests, and then logged out to find that the Mac OS X login window had been corrupted too. I had to reboot to get a clean login window.

My concern is not that xeyes is broken, but that whatever interface its is using to display through XQuartz has a potentially serious memory corruption problem. This may be related to the SHAPE extension.

Unless you plan on fixing this, it won't get fixed. Furthermore, this bug tracking system is not being used any more. If you want to file a new ticket, file it in bugzilla at <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs>

If other system components get corrupted by your use of xeyes, that's certainly an OS X bug and not an XQuartz bug. Nothing that XQuartz does should impact the rest of the system that way.
