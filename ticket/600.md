XQuartz 2.7.2 ignores DPI setting
=================================


I don't know why everyone claims Macs have 96 DPI screens; at least on my screen all X fonts look totally oversize compared to native OS X apps. 75 DPI is a bit undersized, yet it doesn't look like I'm totally blind when someone looks at my monitor. As Mountain Lion (10.8) has no X server any longer (only as stub), I decided to go with XQuartz instead, yet it won't let me set a different DPI.

On 10.7 and below, I used to always run this command:

defaults write org.x.X11 dpi -int 75

and everything was fine the next time I started the XServer. XQuartz ignores this but that is okay, after all it has its own plist. However, running this command:

defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 dpi -int 75

has no effect either. Either setting DPI is broken or currently unsupported. What I cannot understand is why it is no setting in the preferences of XQuartz? After all certain display prefs (like number of colors) can be set in the prefs as well, so why not DPI, which is a fundamental setting, IMHO.

DPI is "dots per inch" ... it's not an issue of being a Mac or not, its about the physical density of your display. If you have a 1920x1200 23" display, the display is approximately 19.5" x 12.2" which is 98.44 DPI.

As for the specific issue of the -dpi command line argument not being passed, that is now fixed in <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xinit/commit/?id=bfed997da5f083e3ddfbda440e114d1261d18b14>

And as for having a GUI for this, DPI has never worked properly in X11 (not just XQuartz). We can determine the exact DPI from CG, so there's no need for the user to provide it. The problem is that X11 itself doesn't work right in this regard.
