Since version 2.7.7 Windows-controls on the top not working
===========================================================


Hello,

Since the update 2.7.7 is installed I am not able to control the upper Windows-controls like dragging the size, close, minimize, maximize and the upper-left-corner menu-functions any more. Also on a webbrowser it is not possible to switch between tabs. I have seen this with Windows-XP as well as with Windows-7. With regards to other OS's I am unable to check.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Insufficient Information*

I'm not sure what Windows has to do with this report, but the related code did not change between 2.7.6 and 2.7.7.

Are you seeing the issue with all windows or just those for a specific app?

You should take a spindump to see what quartz-wm is doing. Maybe it is blocked.

I see this behavior on all applications I tried.

In the meantime I downgraded to 2.7.6 and this did solve the problem. So something has been changed that is causing this problem. The strange thing is that I cannot change the size of the window by dragging the top-edge, nor move the window. Change the size with the right- and bottom-edge is no problem. I didn't try the left-edge.

You aren't expected to be abke to drag-resize the top.

Please figure out reproduction steps as nobody else has reported an issue like this, and if it were as drastic as you report, there would be tons of noise about it.
