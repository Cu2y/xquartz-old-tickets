AIGLX issue
===========


Upon upgrading from the default X11 distributed with 10.5.6 to any current XQuartz X11 (2.3.2.1, 2.3.3 rc2, or 2.4.0 beta1), the X-forwarding over ssh of the molecular dynamics program VMD from a linux machine fails to work properly. The primary VMD window flashes like a strobe light and the displays garbled images of what should be displaying, windows behind, and my desktop image. I've tried from recent Fedora and Ubuntu distributions with the same results, though probably the server machine probably isn't the problem. I also, tried to take a screen shot with Grab, but that image looks perfectly fine, so its not of much use trying to describe this problem. The program can be found here: <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>

I'm guessing it's using GLX. Can you confirm that? Is it trying to use a stereo context?

I believe that it is using GLX. I've posted below the terminal output from the program. I'm not using it in a stereo context.

Can you please try 2.4.1\_alpha1 on SnowLeopard? I fixed a lot of AIGLX related problems in that release, so hopefully it's working for you now.

Can't reproduce and no response. AIGLX support has been changed a lot since the bug was filed.
