Preset colors under Hackedbox in full screen
============================================


> After upgrading to 2.4.0 from 2.3.3.2 the window manager (Hackedbox) stopped reacting to the borderColor parameter in the definition of a style. There was a white bar surrounding the window, and I couldn't change the color.

> Had to roll back to 2.3.3.2, which solved the problem. Seems to be an xserver issue.

The Hackedbox is installed through fink. I guess, installing it and trying to play with the borderColor parameter in the style definition file should reproduce the bug.
