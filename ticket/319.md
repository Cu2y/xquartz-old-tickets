Custom .Xmodmap not being used in recent servers
================================================


In the most recent development servers (such as 1.4.2-apple49), my custom keymaps in .Xmodmap are not being read anymore. I have "Follow system keyboard" unchecked in the preferences.

My .Xmodmap files are working again in the latest servers, so it appears this ticket has been fixed and can be closed.
