Sybylx1.1 Crashes Immediately When Using XQuartz 2.5.2
======================================================


I'm running Sybylx1.1 on a Linux machine and forwarding X11 to Snow Leopard. The stock Sybyl runs using the stock X11 app, but when text is in the OpenGL window the performance decreases significantly. Thus I wanted to try the latest version of XQuartz, however it Sybyl crashes immediately with the following errors.

Starting SYBYL-X (/home/tripos/sybylx1.1/bin/linux/sybyl)

Any help would be much appreciated.
