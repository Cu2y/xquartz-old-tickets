Drawing Xft-text into 15-bit visual windows appears sqeezed
===========================================================


As reported on 20 Jul 2010 on xquartz-dev mailing list,
also XQuartz-2.5.3 offers a 15-bit visual; though if
painting text by Xft this text appears horizontally
squeezed and in 'technicolor'. In the attached demo
the 15-bit window is embedded into a 24-bit one.

To demonstrate this bug please change

> \#define DEPTH 24

into

> \#define DEPTH 15

in the source code.

I just tested this on 2.7.0\_beta3, and it seems to be fine. Are you still having issues? Can you attach a screenshot of the problem if you are?
