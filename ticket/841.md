XQuartz cannot establish any listening sockets if /tmp/ is a link
=================================================================


To save wear and tear on my SSD, I made a link from /tmp/ to /Volumes/HDD/tmp/. When I attempt to launch XQuartz with the link, it will always prompt me that "Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running". If I change the /tmp/ to an actual directory it works fine

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

Seeing as /tmp is by default a symlink on OS X, I doubt this.

You probably have incorrect permissions on the target of the link.

In order to correct the permissions, I had to boot into single user mode and had to change the owner to root:wheel /Volumes/HDD/tmp/

No, you should be able to just use sudo. Also, /tmp should be a symlink to /private/tmp

Make sure you match:

    ~ $ ls -ld /tmp /private/tmp
    drwxrwxrwt 55 root wheel 1870 Mar 28 16:38 /private/tmp
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 root wheel   11 Jan 24 22:12 /tmp -> private/tmp
