Background window doesn't regain focus when another window is killed
====================================================================


If I have two windows open and I kill one program at the terminal (instead of clicking the red close button) two problems occur: 1) the other window doesn't regain focus automatically,
2) Cmd-\` no longer switches between windows. If I then click the window with the mouse, it gets focus and things go back to normal.

This doesn't reproduce in 2.6.2, so it looks like my changes fixed this one.

Actually, I'm still seeing it with 2.6.3 on Snow Leapard. ImageMagick's display is the easiest way for me to reproduce it:

1.  In Terminal: display foo.jpg &
2.  In Terminal: display foo.jpg
3.  Now Cmd-Tab to XQuartz and the most recent display window has focus, and Cmd-\` cycles between X windows.
4.  In Terminal: Ctrl-c to kill the last display command
5.  Now Cmd-Tab back to XQuartz and no window has focus, and Cmd-\` doesn't cycle between windows.

The only way I know to get the focus back to an older window is with the mouse.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
