Returning to fullscreen using Command-Option-A broken in 2.6.0 Snow Leopard
===========================================================================


I just switched to Snow Leopard and XQuartz 2.6.0 and I am having an issue with fullscreen mode. If I am in fullscreen mode and switch out of it using Command-Option-A it switches me to OSX mode (but X11 is still the foreground app). Now if I try to use Command-Option-A to go back to fullscreen mode it doesn't switch. This used to work correctly on previous versions I used (last was Leopard and XQuartz 2.5.3). With 2.6.0 I have to switch to another app and then back to X11 to get back to fullscreen mode. Very annoying!

It works here... Please try with 2.6.1\_beta1 and ask on x11-users if you still have problems.

Well it seems to be working fine for me now. I have no idea what triggered it earlier. I'll let you know if it returns and try with the newer version. Sorry for the noise.

OK, I've seen this a few more times and have figured out how to reproduce it. It only occurs if the mouse happens to be over a Terminal (the OS X terminal) window when you use Command-Option-A to move from fullscreen to OS X desktops (but still in X11). If the mouse pointer is over a Terminal window then hitting Command-Option-A again will not switch back to the fullscreen mode. Moving the mouse pointer from being over a Terminal window (without clicking) will allow one to Command-Option-A back to fullsceen mode. I have not tried with 2.6.1\_beta1 yet, I will try to do that soon.

works for me. Please ask on the mailing list if you still have problems.

I just tried 2.6.1\_beta1 and have the same issue. I should have noted that I use focus follows mouse in Terminal. It appears there is a problem with focus follows mouse in Terminal in Snow Leopard. For example, from <http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/terminal-commands-for-hidden-settings-in-snow-leopard.html>

"In Leopard there was a Terminal command to make the Terminal's window focus change with mouse movement. If you had previously enabled this, you will find things don't work quite right in Snow Leopard when you use Command-Tab to switch between applications in different spaces. To fix this, you will need to disable the focus follows mouse behaviour using the following command:

defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -string NO"

I guess the problems go deeper than just spaces (which I don't use). I have no desire to turn off Focus Follows Mouse in Terminal so I guess I will have to live with this. I hope Apple fixes this problem soon.

PS I fail to understand why you don't think this bug is worthy of discussion here (but I will leave it closed to save you the trouble of closing it again).

Well, it's obviously not an X11 bug, so this should be closed.

Re: Terminal.app behaving this way, file a bug with Apple: <http://bugreport.apple.com>

Re: Turning off FFM in Terminal, I'm confused because you say you don't know how to turn it off, yet you turned it on, and you copy/pasted the command to turn it off...

Well, it was not obvious until my last report. If you knew otherwise you should have mentioned it.

As for turning off FFM in Terminal. I know how. I just said that I don't want to loose FFM so I will live with this quirk. I will file a bug report with Apple, but since this problem appears to have existed since the start of Snow Leopard I am very doubtful it will be fixed.

I did not know that it was Terminal.app, but based on your earlier reports, it seemed like it was a configuration issue on your end (which it was), so it was not actually a bug and should not be filed here.
