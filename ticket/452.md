X11 windows loses focus after few seconds
=========================================


I've installed XQuartz 2.5.3 on my iMac (Snow Leopard).

I use xfig or xemacs a moment (between 2mn and an hour) and then, the window loses focus. If I clic on the window, it loses focus 2 seconds later. And the same thing appends with all the X11 windows.

I've tried to restart XQuartz but it's not enough, the same problem appears. I have to restart the session.

CC me, this is seriously the most annoying bug I've ever came across with.
