X Server stops responding to keyboard and mouse input
=====================================================


After running for some time, all windows displayed by the X server will become unresponsive both to mouse clicks and keypresses. The windows also cannot be moved or resized and clicking in them does not raise or focus them, however, selecting windows from the Window menu will raise that window but it remains unresponsive. The menus in the Mac menubar contine to respond and it is even possible to launch additional programs, but no user input reaches these programs either.

Have you run xev or used 'xinput test' when in this state?

What versions of XQuartz are you seeing this with?
