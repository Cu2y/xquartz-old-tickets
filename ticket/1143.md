X window created and listed, but not visible
============================================


I just upgraded from OS X 10.6.8 (where I was using XQuartz 2.7.5 without issue) to OS X 10.9.2 a couple weeks ago. After doing so, I installed the latest Xcode. Since then, I have experienced the following behavior, which has not been resolved by re-installing XQuartz 2.7.5:

Using an ssh connection with X11 forwarding, a few X windows may open fine. But at some point, an X window opens and is understood to be open by the "Windows" menu of XQuartz. However, I see no visual appearance of the window. If I then kill the program that produced the X window, then quit XQuartz, then the next time I run the program that creates the X window there is no problem.

Thanks for any help.

Hm. Just now I had a window disappear on me.

I ran the program that created an X window (gvim in this case), went away from the computer for a bit, then came back and tried to bring the X window to the foreground after using Mail. XQuartz would not respond. I then brought some other app to the foreground, and that's when the X window disappeared. I could then bring XQuartz to be the foreground app, but the situation stands with the window listed under XQuartz windows, but the window itself is not visible.

If it's any help, I am pasting here my entire ~/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log at the time of the window disappearance. Also, I'm using dual screen on a 2010 MacBook Pro + very old LCD cinema display.

I found this time that killing my gvim program and re-running it without quitting XQuartz permitted the X window to appear anew, with a new entry in the aforementioned log:

Please let me know if you think there is something else I should "watch".

Thanks,

Today I updated to OS X 10.9.3 and then XQuartz 2.7.6. No improvement. Please let me know if there is something I can do to help debug this (e.g. would Quartz Debug provide anything useful?).

Thanks,

It seems that a relevant piece of information is the fact that this problem is only occurring when I am using dual displays. It does not happen when I am either using a single display, or using the dual displays in a mirrored-display configuration. In fact, when a window "disappears" (but, I remind, is still listed in the Windows menu), if I switch to mirrored mode, the window appears. Switching back and forth between mirrors and un-mirrored modes makes the window appear and disappear. So it is clear that the window is not truly lost, but I simply cannot see it in un-mirrored mode.

I will also reiterate that this is not happening to all X windows. I generally can use XQuartz for a few hours each day before this problem hits. I now have two solutions: restart the XQuartz app, or temporarily switch to mirrored displays.

Thanks for any help or feedback,
-Gene

This may be a bug in CoreGraphics then... I've seen this happen for other applications as well when entering Mission Control or app exposé. Was that involved in any way?

I haven't noticed any correlation with Mission Control or app exposé. For example, this morning, I started with XQuartz not running, then started a (remote, over ssh) X11 program which automatically launched XQuartz. However, the X11 window never appeared, and XQuartz looks like it's running just fine, with the X11 window listed in its Window menu. I did not once use Mission Control or Exposé this morning before or during any of this. Mirroring the displays then let's me see the X11 window.

Perhaps another piece of information: when I turn off mirroring, the screens go black for a moment during the switchover (which I think is probably as designed), and when they come back from being momentarily black, I momentarily see the X11 window, which then quickly disappears. It's as if XQuartz is trying to sort out the current situation with the displays and realizes the X11 window should be drawn differently in some manner.

Do you think there are any log files I should be looking at to glean more useful information? I'm happy to provide any additional information I can.

Thanks,
-Gene

FWIW, I am still frequently experiencing this with vers. 2.7.7 on OS X 10.9.4.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
