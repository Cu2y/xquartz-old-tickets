XQuartz windows on top after wake from display sleep
====================================================


This is a dupe of [\#⁠391](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/391), but that seems to be lost.

After display sleep, the X11 windows are all on top. They do not have focus, but they do cover other windows. This happens regardless of whether I use Spaces.

I have:

> XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0)
> OS X 10.8.5

Not sure what you mean by "lost" ...
