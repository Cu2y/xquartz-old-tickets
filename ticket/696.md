libxcb update to prevent deadlock in wine
=========================================


This is a request to update libxcb to at least libxcb 1.9. The current version causes deadlocks in wine. The corresponding bug report in WineHQ is <http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31882>. libxcb 1.9 apparently includes a multithreading patch (comment [\#⁠13](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/13)) which fixes these deadlocks.
