xterms travel between spaces
============================


XQuartz 2.3.3.1 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple42)
OSX 10.5.7

When switching between Spaces, an xterm will often move from one Space to another. In my Spaces set-up, I have two Spaces side-by-side. With three xterms in Space 1, I go to Space 2. All is well and the xterms stay put. When I return to Space 1, frequently an xterm will disappear from Space 1 and be put in Space 2.

In a few tests, this was always the xterm that had been the active xterm prior to switching to Space 2.

The window-hopping occurs when X11.app is the active application. It doesn't happen when Safari is the active application. I haven't tested others.

I can drag the xterm back to the proper Space.

Minimizing the xterm, moving to the proper Space, and then maximizing the xterm does not work. That just returns me to the previous Space and opens the xterm.
