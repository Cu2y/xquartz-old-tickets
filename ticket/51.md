fixed by this diff, I believe. There's also some locking problems in libGL, but not sure where to report those.

Replying to [macosforge@racoonfink.com](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/51):

I got the problem above with wine as well with the default X11 of Leopard, so I updated to the latest X11 2.1.4 + Mac OS X 10.5.2 update. It solved the problem but now I just get this:

    [yun@magneto wine-0.9.55]$ DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11/lib WINEDEBUG=+wgl ./wine /tmp/Lesson05/Lesson5.exe 
    trace:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo GL version             : 2.0 ATI-1.5.18.

    trace:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo GLX version            : 1.2.
    trace:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo Server GLX version     : 1.2.

    trace:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo Client GLX vendor:     : SGI.
    trace:wgl:X11DRV_WineGL_InitOpenglInfo Direct rendering enabled: True

It just hangs there..and no screen is created at all in my X11. I'm not sure if this bug is related to this ticket though.

Investigated where it exactly hangs, which is the following call:

from ./dlls/winex11.drv/opengl.c

        if(vis) XFree(vis);
        if(ctx) {
            ERR("calling pglXMakeCurrent\n");
            pglXMakeCurrent(gdi_display, None, NULL);
            ERR("done\n");
            pglXDestroyContext(gdi_display, ctx);
        }

It locks up at "pglXMakeCurrent", as it never returns.

I believe it's probably hanging because libGL hasn't been fixed to address the second issue here.

It's another bug. Use the latest release of X11, not the old 2.1.4
