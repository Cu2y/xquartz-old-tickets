no\_quit\_alert fails
=====================


Trying to turn off the dialog on quitting, does not work in Mac 10.8 and XQ 2.7.2

    % defaults write org.x.X11 no_quit_alert -boolean true
    % defaults read org.x.X11
    {
        "app_to_run" = "/usr/bin/true";
        "cache_fonts" = 1;
        "done_xinit_check" = 1;
        "login_shell" = "/bin/sh";
        "no_auth" = 0;
        "no_quit_alert" = 1;
        "nolisten_tcp" = 1;
        "startx_script" = "/usr/X11/bin/startx";
    }
    %

When Command-Q, still get the alert about quitting.

You're using the wrong defaults domain.
