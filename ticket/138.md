Xquartz 2.30 fails to load keymap from US - International
=========================================================


The command startx works pretty nice if using the keyboard layout U.S., but if instead i use US - International, a custom keyboard input from <http://www.brockerhoff.net/usi/> it does not work. The Stock version of X11 that comes with Leopard doens't show this problem.

Same thing here, just adding me to the cc list.

-   **Version** set to *2.3.0 (xserver-1.4)*

If you nuke the /usr/X11/share/X11/xkb directory (move it somewhere else to back it up), I think that will "fix" the problem... Please try this.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*

So here's the core part of that log:

    04/08/08 09:29:08 org.x.startx[3266] Couldn't get uchr or kchr resource 
    04/08/08 09:29:08 org.x.startx[3266] Fatal server error: 
    04/08/08 09:29:08 org.x.startx[3266] Could not build a valid keymap. 
    04/08/08 09:29:08 org.x.startx[3266]    AbortDDX 

This fatal error occurs in quartzKeyboard.c:

        TISInputSourceRef currentKeyLayoutRef = TISCopyCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSource();
        keyboard_type = LMGetKbdType ();
        if (currentKeyLayoutRef) {
          CFDataRef currentKeyLayoutDataRef = (CFDataRef )TISGetInputSourceProperty(currentKeyLayoutRef, kTISPropertyUnicodeKeyLayoutData);
          if (currentKeyLayoutDataRef) chr_data = CFDataGetBytePtr(currentKeyLayoutDataRef);
        }

        if (chr_data == NULL) {
          ErrorF ( "Couldn't get uchr or kchr resource\n");
          return FALSE;
        }

I recently removed a fallback that was probably still triggering for your setup, but that fallback was using deprecated code slated for removal (and the functionality replaced by this code path).

I wonder if the keyboard data from <http://www.brockerhoff.net/usi> is causing a problem here.

Are you seeing this issue with any apple-provided keyboard layouts?

No, using default keyboard layouts everything' s fine. I guess I should contact the USI keyboard layout developer and ask him for a fix.

Thanks for your help.

I wouldn't punt to him just yet. Users have been reporting this with the GB layout as well (which is Apple supplied)...

Ok then, I'll wait until things are clearer on this issue.

Please try out 2.3.1\_beta1 and report back. Does it work for you? Please copy the relevant debug sections from your system log (EVEN IF IT'S WORKING). See this post for more information:

<http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/xquartz-dev/2008-August/000911.html>

Yes, it's working now. Here's the relevant log part:

    10/08/08 19:24:18 org.x.startx[3186] X11.app: Error detected in determining keyboard layout.  Please report this error at http://xquartz.macosforge.org

    10/08/08 19:24:18 org.x.startx[3186] X11.app: Fallback succeeded, but this is still a bug.  Please report the above information.

You are probably aware, but the value in **currentKeyLayoutRef** changes each time I start a new server instance.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Ok, so this is slightly a bug in your keyboard layout. I'll leave the workaround in place for now, but you should report this information to the keyboard layout provider:

"""
Any KCHR can be converted to an XML-style keyboard layout using the tools here:

<http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/download/>

The tool isn't listed on the download page, but it's included in the install. It's called klkchrtoxml.

We strongly recommend that people using third-party keyboard layouts that are not already in XML format convert them.
"""
