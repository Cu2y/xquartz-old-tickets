X11
===


I have Bible Program called: BIBLE EXPLORER 4, which in the past I had X11 to open it on my Mac~Currently I'm runningOS X 10.9.3 Maveric.
When I wanted to download this it made me download XQuartz-2.7.6.dmg instead.
I have done the download, but my Bible program is still 'asking' for X11
HELP!
Thanks
Richard

Not an XQuartz bug. You should contact the developer of your app and ask them to fix it.
