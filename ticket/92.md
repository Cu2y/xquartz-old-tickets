2.2 breaks fonts on ppc
=======================


I have been getting very odd results when I attempt to use the 2.2 rc builds on my ppc laptop. Any fonts that use freetype are 100% garbled, as can be seen in <http://chris.users.finkproject.org/bad-x11.png>. I even did a clean OS X 10.5 install, then all the updates from apple, and there were no problems. As soon as I installed the 2.2 rc3 any freetype fonts were garbled. The only thing working was xterm, xman, and other utilities like that.

After that I did pkgutil --unlink org.x.x11.pkg, reinstalled the apple X11 packages and the few included with the essentials package, then the 2.1.4 release, and the problem is still there. This leads me to think that there is some configuration clash somewhere that is going on in the 2.2 install, as there should be no files left on my system from the 2.2 package. Has anyone else ever seen a problem like this?

btw the mailing list eats my posts, I tried posting this 3 different times and it never showed up :/

What is the output of 'otool -L /path/to/konsole'? Judging by the info I see in Terminal.app, it looks like you might be using fink libs rather than ours... so the problem might be there...

Yes, I have fink installed, but I get the same results using the guest account with the /sw folder renamed and a clean path, calling /usr/X11/bin/xterm -fa "Courier New" -fs 13.

Can you please install this updated version of font\_cache.sh (install it over /usr/X11/bin/font\_cache ... note that the destination file lacks the .sh extension).

Then run:
sudo font\_cache -f -s

Now try starting your app. If it still shows mucked up fonts, do the following:
sudo mv /usr/X11/bin/ttmkfdir /usr/X11/bin/ttmkfdir.sux
sudo font\_cache -f -s

Sorry, I didn't have a machine to test your fixes on until now. I tried everything you suggested, and nothing worked. I then installed 10.5.3 rev 29 and no change, but after that I tried the 2.3rc1 build of x11 and everything seemed to work normally again. I'm not sure what changed, but all seems well now.
