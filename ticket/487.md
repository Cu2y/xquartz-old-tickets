Stuck mightymouse button after squeezing sides to trigger expose
================================================================


Apologies for the formatting of this ticket, it seems the tool I'm typing into to submit this ticket does not respect individual carriage returns but it does so for double carriage returns!

I have a mightymouse whose side buttons are set to trigger expose when squeezed. If I invoke expose this way and select a regular Mac window and then repeat and select an X11 window then a variety of stuck mouse button situations arise e.g. you're stuck in the middle of a selection rectangle, you're stuck in the middle of a window move. In each case, the location of the mouse arrow on the screen is wildly offset from where X11 thinks the mouse location is. Additionally, just doing expose events to induce this issue, I see evidence in the X11 CAD tools I was using that a regular keyboard character depression was interpreted e.g. "i" or "z".

My debug strategy (based solely on Jeremy's advice) is as follows:

I have a ~/.xinitrc.d directory which contains two files:

99-quartz-wm.sh which contains:
export DEBUG=1
exec /usr/bin/quartz-wm &gt; /tmp/quartz-wm.log 2&gt;&1

and 50-xterm.sh which contains:
exec /opt/X11/bin/xterm

Launch X11 (which an xterm with no decoration ) and then enter:
DEBUG=1 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm &gt;& /tmp/quartz-wm.log

So to summarize, when this X11 issue comes up I:

-   run "xev" and "xinput test pointer" in separate terminal windows (although I don't know how to interpret what I see).
-   provide the tail end of /tmp/quartz-wm.log
-   "killall quartz-wm" and then try restarting with "/opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm" (I also tried "/usr/bin/quartz-wm").

I have found no reliable way to restore X11 to it's normal state. I have had the above procedure work and not work to fix the problem.
