Mouse/keyboard input doesn't work when running jconsole or jvirtualvm on the server
===================================================================================


I'm using XQuartz to connect from a Mac OS X machine (10.9.5) to a Debian linux server. Some linux applications (such as xcalc) display and function fine. Other java applications, like jconsole or jvirtualvm, bring up the GUI, but the mouse/keyboard inputs do not appear to go through (thus rendering the application unusable).

If it works fine with most apps but not a couple java ones, I'd suggest you talk with the java developers to figure out why they're misbehaving.
