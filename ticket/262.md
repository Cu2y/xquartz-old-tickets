Grey screen
===========


X11 was working fine yesterday. I installed xlispstat via FINK and it worked with no problems. Updated to 10.5.7 today and now, when X11 starts up, the whole screen goes grey with any X11 windows on top but no other native MacOSX applications are visible. I can activate Expose which allows all other windows to be seen and I can then select another application before quitting X11 via the dock. I have updated to X11 2.3.3.

Your preferences are set for fullscreen X11. hit cmd-opt-a to get out of it and change your preferences if that's what you want.

Replying to [p.h.jones@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/262):

I opened the same issue as ticket 263, though I guess I could/should have reopened 262.
