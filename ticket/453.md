Xnest 2.5.3 occasionally crashes by xterm
=========================================


If I launch

> Xnest :2 &

and then

> DISPLAY=:2 xterm -fa mono-10 &

then Xnest sometimes (i.e. not always) crashes (under XQuartz 2.5.3) with

X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)

> Major opcode of failed request: 73 (X\_GetImage)
> Serial number of failed request: 834
> Current serial number in output stream: 834

xterm: fatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) or KillClient on X server ":2.0"

It may have something to do with Xft, as the attached minimalistic
program crashes Xnest-2.5.3 too.

XQuartz 2.7.2's Xnest is based on much newer sources (although Xephyr is still dated). Could you please give it a try?
