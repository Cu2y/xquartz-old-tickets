user shell environment can inhibit X startup
============================================


The login shell environment can prevent X from launching successfully.
If I chsh to /bin/ksh, and create .profile containing the single line:

> set -o vi ignoreeof

X won't start (icons bounces for a long time, etc.)

If I chsh to bash or remove this line, X starts as expected.

I can dig further if you like. Apparently your startup process may involve scripts that can fail depending on the user's login environment. Things like this are going to be extremely difficult for end users to cope with.

This is not a bug in X11. It's a bug in the users' invalid .profile
