GLXFBConfigs not working
========================


XQuartz does not support GLX 1.3 and it is therefore necessary to use the corresponding GLX 1.2 extensions, which do not work.

glXChooseFBConfigSGIX seems to work, but glXCreateContextWithConfigSGIX always returns 0 and no X11 error.

The GLX\_SGIX\_fbconfig extension is exported by the server. See also <http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/SGIX/fbconfig.txt>

Ideally XQuartz should be upgraded to GLX 1.4 (like Linux uses) or at least implement the supported extensions correctly.

I'm guessing you're on an old version. You should certainly upgrade.

1) We are using GLX version 1.4:

        screen->base.GLXversion = strdup("1.4");
        screen->base.GLXextensions = strdup("GLX_SGIX_fbconfig "
                                            "GLX_SGIS_multisample "
                                            "GLX_ARB_multisample "
                                            "GLX_EXT_visual_info "
                                            "GLX_EXT_import_context ");

2) You're crashing in \_X11TransWritev which doesn't even exist any more.

I can't reproduce this. Please see the attached screenshot. What am I missing?

Yeah, that's some issue in mesa not reporting the right version. I asked mesa devs about it, and they were aware of it... but it shouldn't affect actual behavior other than the reported version.

As for your crash, my guess is you aren't using /opt/X11/lib/libX11.dylib like you think you are... Please ask followups on the xquartz-dev mailing list.
