Quartz cannot be opened on Yosemite
===================================


Tried installing XQuartz 2.7.7 on Mac OSX 10.10.2. Started getting errors "xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: :0.0". Tried reinstalling but then discovered the error was actually due to "XQuartz cannot be opened because of a problem". Tried upgrading to OS X 10.10.3. No change. Tried removing /usr/X11, /opt/X11 and /usr/X11R6 and reinstalling XQuartz. No improvement, and things got worse as R stopped working, complaining about missing symbols expected in /opt/X11/lib/libPng.dylib.

Problem report attached.

Restored backup to get R working again. Trying to reproduce conditions.

I have the same problem while using Mac OSX 10.10.5. To get around, I use the Terminal of X11, until somebody will find why the DISPLAY is not being defined. Strangely, I have another computer that runs OSX 10.10.5 with XQuartz 2.7.7 and that works fine.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

This is all user error. The crash log clearly shows:

DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/local/cula/lib:/opt/X11/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/ImageMagick-6.3.5/lib

Don't do that.

cizmas, your issue is completely unrelated and likely to you unsetting DISPLAY in init scripts or similar.

Both of you, feel free to ask for help on the mailing list. This is not the right forum for support.

Thanks.
