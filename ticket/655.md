X11/XQUARTZ
===========


I updated to xquartz & my macbook pro doesn't recognize x11. I tried to open an app that normally uses x11 & now it doesn't open. I'm running mountain lion.

It looks like bug [\#⁠651](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/651) (which occurs on Lion 10.7.5)...

Have you tried to start the X server manually (Finder | XQuar, duoble click...)?
