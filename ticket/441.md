Window activation by Cmd-tab or clicking XQuarts icon in Dock
=============================================================


Hello Developers,

When I uncheck "When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application" in the Spaces panel in System Preferences, I have to switch to XQuartz twice by cmd-tab or clicking the XQuarts icon in Dock to bring the all X11 windows to front.

I remember that similar problem was reported in official X11 in Tiger.

I do not know if this problem is raised from XQuartz side or Apple side. But if it could be solved from XQuartz side, I would be very happy. In addition I would like to know if there already exists any known workaround.

I thought there was a bug open for this already...

Do the changes in 2.6.3 fix this issue for you?
