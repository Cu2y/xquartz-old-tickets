Crash in QuartzRandRUpdateFakeModes after monitor sleep
=======================================================


Crash in QuartzRandRUpdateFakeModes after monitor wakes up from sleep.
This happens when I have an external monitor attached to the
laptop. The laptop screen is closed all the time. The crash does not
occur when I am setting up the monitor. It occurs after a period of
inactivity during which the monitor goes to sleep (the system does not
sleep in this instance). I do not know if it crashes while the monitor
is going to sleep, during the sleep, or when it is waking up from
sleep. Probably the latter.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Priority** changed from *Important* to *Expected*

This is probably due to us returning FALSE in the case where there are 0 displays in the RandR code but falling back to a stub 800x600 display in that case in the xpr code.

Can you please test 2.6.1\_beta1 to see if this is fixed. I believe it should be working now.

I was experiencing the same crashes as described in this ticket. I upgraded to 2.6.1\_beta1 and this does not seem to have solved the problem. I'll attach the complete crash report to this ticket.

This happens when my Macbook Pro wakes from sleep after I have disconnected my extermal monitor. At work, I use an external monitor, with the lid of the Macbook closed. When I disconnect the monitor, the Macbook goes to sleep. Then, when I open the Macbook again at home, I'll immediately get a crash report regarding Xquartz.

The only thing that would match that crash report would be an over-release or unretained mode reference, but those look fine to me...

Still present with 2.6.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.7 (x86\_64). Can we do something to help with debugging? This happens seemingly at random when my laptop goes to sleep connected to an external Apple Display and wakes up detached from it.

I can't reproduce this. I started with a 24" LED Cinema attached to my MBP while clamshelled. I launched two xterms, and from each, I launched glxgears. I placed the two glxgears windows in the upper left and lower right of the display. I then disconnected the display port followed shortly after by the power cable. I then waited for the machine to sleep (apple light was no longer illuminated, and the front light began to pulse).

I then opened the laptop lid. The lower-right glxgears had moved to the upper left as expected, and all were behaving reasonably.

Please provide more information (exact steps from launch) on how to reproduce this problem.

I was using 2.6.2\_beta1, so please test with that.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/463#comment:10):

> Please provide more information (exact steps from launch) on how to reproduce this problem.

Well, as I said, this does not happen in a systematic manner, which is why I offered to run a log-enabled build rather than have you jump through hoops. I would say it happens less than 5% of the time I do the following:

1.  Have X11 open
2.  Connect an Apple Cinema Display (27") + power + USB keyboard with the MBP closed.
3.  Disconnect all three cables, MBP still shut.
4.  Some time later, open the MBP and see a X11 crash dialog.

I do not know currently if the order in which cables are disconnected (power then display, or display then power) makes a difference. I'll try to disconnect them in specific order from now on.

Also of note, I think I've seen it happen without any X11 window open.

PS: I tried to repeatedly connect and disconnect this morning, but after ~15 times not seeing any crash, I have to get back to work.

> I was using 2.6.2\_beta1, so please test with that.

Yes.

Hi, I’m having the same issue. An external monitor is plugged into a notebook which is usually closed with the screen off, and XQuartz crashes occasionally when plugging or unplugging the external monitor, turning the external monitor on, or selecting “Detect displays.”

I ran the following experiment: Start XQuartz. Open one xterm with Command-N, open a second xterm with xterm -geometry +1257+793 (the coords from a previous crash, in case that has anything to do with it). Turn the external monitor off, wait a few seconds, then back on. If the two xterms have moved to the upper-left corner, then restart X11.

I did this 50 times. XQuartz crashed 8 times, on trials 9, 19, 30, 38, 41, 45, 46, and 47. The windows moved around but there was no crash on trials 29, 37, and 49.

All of the stack traces from this experiment have QuartzRandRUpdateFakeModes at or near the top.

XQuartz 2.6.2\_beta1 (xorg-server 1.10.0.902)
Mac OS 10.6.7

Interesting. Thanks for the detailed report. I'm working on making logging much better in xorg-server and will hopefully have something for you to test soon.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.6.2* to *2.7.0*

This is a top issue for 2.7.0. Once the logging infrastructure is worked out, I'll put out a beta for you guys to use. Hopefully that'll be in the next month or so.

I'm still improving the logging for 2.7.0\_alpha1, but in the mean time, it might help to run XQuartz with guard malloc. Add the following to the top of your /Applciations/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 script (just below the \#!/bin/bash line):

    exec 1> /tmp/X11.out.log  2> /tmp/X11.err.log
    export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib

This will create a bunch of logging about memory allocations and crash the application when it first notices a problem. The generated logs (crash log and /tmp/X11.err.log) should prove helpful.

I would expect /tmp/X11.out.log to be empty, but there is no way that /tmp/X11.err.log could be empty. Can you please try again?

Are you able to reproduce it every time with GuardMalloc, or is it still hit-or-miss? I really want to reproduce this myself rather than relying on logs...

This time it crashed on the fifth try, with a SIGSEGV instead of Guard\_Malloc’s SIGBUS.

Ok, can you try running X11 in gdb with malloc logging, then capture the history at the time of the crash? Do the following:

Terminal.app, Tab 1:

    $ gdb /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
    (gdb) set env MallocStackLogging 1
    (gdb) set env MallocScribble 1
    (gdb) set env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib
    (gdb) run
    …
    Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
         Reason: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at address: ...
    (gdb) bt

Terminal.app, Tab 2 (Once X11 has crashed in gdb):

    $ malloc_history X11.bin -all_events > malloc_history.log

Provide me with malloc\_history.log, the console output from Tab 1, and if you are familiar with debugging in gdb, it would be helpful if you could provide me with variables that you think are appropriate.

Thanks.

When it crashes, the number after "KERN\_PROTECTION\_FAILURE at address" is the address that was trying to be acted upon. The malloc\_history command I gave you will print the entire history (which I'll have to sift through). If you could, please also run:

$ malloc\_history X11.bin &lt;the address reported&gt;

If you see "no stack logs found for ..." printed in the report, try a number a little bit less or a little more than the one printed.

I found one issue in the RandR code that might've been related to what you are seeing (but I'm not certain). Can you try the attached patch? Apply it to server-1.10-apple and rebuild.

I'm also building you the server to try, but you should make sure to update to 2.6.2 before dropping it in. I notice you're still on the beta.

Try this.

    curl -LO http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/X11.bin-PR-463.bz2
    bunzip2 X11.bin-PR-463.bz2
    sudo mv /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin.bak

    sudo chmod 755 /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

My guess is that you will see this printed in your log, and you won't crash; Unable to determine current display mode.

I applied the patch to server-1.10-apple (11fa947e94d52d560cad0a8c1f10dce6748db3f1) and built. It doesn’t seem to crash anymore, great! And the log file generally says something like

    Sat May 14 22:43:30 impact X11.bin[95043] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetNumberOfDisplayModes
    Sat May 14 22:43:30 impact X11.bin[95043] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetCurrentDisplayMode
    Sat May 14 22:43:30 impact X11.bin[95043] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetNumberOfDisplayModes
    Unable to determine current display mode.

    Sat May 14 22:43:52 impact X11.bin[95043] <Error>: kCGErrorCannotComplete: CGSSetWindowColorSpace: Cannot create color profile

But although it didn’t crash anymore when turning off the monitor, all the X windows did move to the upper-left corner 16 out of 20 times.

Great! Thanks for testing and getting me that gmalloc crash report. It's so much easier diagnosing memory management issues when you know where the problem is.

Now those CGErrors are bizarre. It looks to me like I'm doing ample sanity checking that would prevent the color space issues. Would you mind installing this libXplugin:

    curl -LO http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/libXplugin.1.dylib-PR-463.bz2
    bunzip2 libXplugin.1.dylib-PR-463.bz2
    sudo mv /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib.bak
    sudo cp libXplugin.1.dylib-PR-463 /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib
    sudo chmod 755 /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib

That prints out some diagnostic info to stderr around my calls to CGSSetWindowColorSpace which should help hone in on why it's being called with an invalid value.

Ok, the colorspace CGErrors will be addressed with a workaround in 2.7.0\_alpha1 ... I think the others regarding \# of displays can't be addressed in X11 itself since that is coming from CoreGraphics when there are no displays.

There was one more crasher that isn't included in the fix above. Please verify with 2.6.3\_rc1 or later.

Great, thanks! It doesn’t crash anymore.

However there is one oddity with window placement when the monitor comes back on. xterms with their top-left corners outside the 1280x800 rectangle of the closed and inactive laptop display move to the top-left corner when the external monitor is power-cycled. That is, if I place xterms at +1279+0 and +1280+0, then power-cycle the external monitor, xterm +1280+0 moves to the top-left corner but xterm +1279+0 stays put. Similarly for +0+778 and +0+777--guess the menu bar is 22 pixels high? Anything further away from the top-left corner moves there too.

Can you make another bug for the placement issue and provide more info (a screen capture using QuickTime X or a couple of screenshots would be helpful).
