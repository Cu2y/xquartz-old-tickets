Yosemite XQuartz App Installs to Wrong Location
===============================================


Installed XQuartz (2.7.7) and WireShark (1.12.1) under OS X 10.10 Yosemite.
Tried launching WireShark only to get dialog requesting location of X11.
Looking in /Applications/Utilities I noticed XQuartz.app was not there.
Looking at /var/log/install.log it appears the XQuartz installer found an old version of the app on a removable drive and installed X11.app there instead.
Unmounting the removable drive and reinstalling XQuartz fixed the problem.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

This is behaving correctly. The installer intentionally updates the relocated app by asking LaunchServices where the app is.
