Command-Q and third party window managers
=========================================


I wrote:

When I'm using QuartzWM and hit Command-Q, a nice window pops up asking me if I'm sure I want to quit X11. When I'm using another window manager (fvwm) and accidentally hit Command-Q, all 20 of my X11 windows disappear and I end up swearing very loudly.

Is there a way to get that pop-up to appear for other window managers?

Thanks!

Then Jeremy wrote:

Hmm... possibly... essentially what happens is:

You press command-q
We then check a 'can\_quit' flag to determine if we have open windows:

if (can\_quit

\[X11App prefs\_get\_boolean:@PREFS\_NO\_QUIT\_ALERT

default:NO\])

> return NSTerminateNow;

can\_quit is initialized to true in QuartzInitInput() and is modified
through the AppleWM protocol extension.

quartz-wm manages setting it to true or false based on the number of open
windows. This logic can probably be changed to

initialize can\_quit to false
when quartz-wm starts, have it set can\_quit to true
