Xterm top window bar can be moved under the main window menubar
===============================================================


It seems to be possible to push the top line of an Xterm window under the menu bar - once there the window is immovable because you cannot get to the top bar of the xterm to grab it.

I don’t have full screen selected in Preferences so I guess I don’t expect this behaviour.

I am unsure if this has always been the case. Panic not if I am querying a known ‘feature’.
