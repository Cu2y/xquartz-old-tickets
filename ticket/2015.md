X Toolkit Warning in XmTextField
================================


For many years of NX in mac and Linux, we have the resource file to define
the font list for the text displaying in the dialogs, such as Ugnx9 which
resided in the directory defined by XAPPLRESDIR.

In the resource file, we usually defined the font list for XmText as the following

\*Ugnx10\*XmTextField\*fontList: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-\*-iso8859-1

With thses definitons, we can run NX successfully in many releases of Linux, and Mac
with Darwin 12.4.0 (OS X 10.8.4) and earlier. But from Darwin 13.3.0 (OS X 10.9.4)
and Darwin 14.0.0 (OS X 10.10), we got the following warnings in the
XmFileSelectionBox with empty text on the filter widget.

X Toolkit Warning:

> Name: FilterText
> Class: XmTextField
> Character '\\57' not supported in font. Discarded.

X Toolkit Warning:

> Name: FilterText
> Class: XmTextField
> Character '\\125' not supported in font. Discarded.

By adding the ":" into the end of the XmTextField font list as the following

\*Ugnx10\*XmTextField\*fontList: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-\*-iso8859-1:

the above warnings had gone and we can interact with the XmFileSelectionBox in mac OS X 10.9
and 10.10 as before.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Insufficient Information*

Can you be a bit more specific on your version information. I highly doubt that the issue has anything to do with OS X versions. It's more likely that the version of XQuartz you installed was different between the two OS X versions or the version of motif you installed on the systems was different.

If this really is an issue triggered \*just\* by an OS X update, then the bug should be filed at <http://bugreport.apple.com>, but you'll need to provide a reduced test case. I suggest debugging openmotif to figure out how it handles XmTextField and reducing from there if that is the case.
