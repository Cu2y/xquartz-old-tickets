glxinfo SIGBUS using ssh tunnel and PC Xming, eXceed X server
=============================================================


glxinfo gives a SIGBUS when run from a remote terminal using ssh tunneling. Non-GL
apps such as xclock, xdpyinfo work from the same session. "glxinfo -b" reports "56"
without SIGBUS.

glxinfo and apps that use libgl did work with older Xquartz versions

Please give a more verbose description of the systems involved. What is your local system (OSX, linux, etc)? What is your remote system? Which system(s) have which versions of X11 on them?

Oh, sorry... that info was in the title.

This is a known problem and expected behavior for now. Our libGL is local-only. The server supports AIGLX from remote clients still.

If you need AIGLX from an OSX machine, I suggest using mesa's libGL for now.

How can an app determine that libGL is local only? Some scripts use glxinfo.

glxinfo should be usable. e.g., a local-only libGL should not cause bus errors in glxinfo.

That is true. The segfault will be fixed, but it will still exit with an error message.
