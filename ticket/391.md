Coming out of sleep display will switches to X11.app (switching Spaces)
=======================================================================


In a nutshell, X11.app seems to want to steal focus coming out of Sleep Display even if it means switching Spaces.

Leopard 10.5.8...

I have Spaces enabled on a 3x3 grid, I also have Sleep Display on an Active Corner. I notice that with 2.5.0 if I am in Space 6 with just Firefox.app and put the display to sleep and then come out of sleep, it will immediately switch to Space 9 which has an X11.app active (xterm). (This behavior is extremely annoying.) Other focused native apps like iTunes behave similarly.

If I have an xterm and Firefox (and Firefox is active and in foreground) in Space 6 and then Sleep the Display and then come out of it, I'll still be in Space 6, but the xterm will be on top, though Firefox will still be active. If the xterm is active on sleeping the display, then xterm and X11.app will be active on coming out of sleep.

I can't reproduce this with 2.5.1\_beta3 on SL... I'll try 2.5.0 on Leopard on Monday.

Originally posted as ticket [\#⁠392](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/392)

I wonder if there are any similar setup values between my system and Kaufman's? I do not use Spaces and I have SL on this machine. I have not noticed this problem on my Leopard G5 with 2.5.0.

X11 windows come to front with mouse click in non-X11 window. This occurs only after the screen or computer goes to sleep and the mouse is clicked or a key is pressed to wake the computer or unblank the screen.

I am running 2.5.1\_beta3, but this bug was also in 2.5.0, and the two previous beta 2.51s. I have a latest revision 13" MBP (SL 10.6.3).

If there are open X11 windows (i.e. not minimized), they come to the front even though they were not when the computer went to sleep or the screen blanked. The menu bar does not change--i.e. it stays as the program (such as Safari) that was on top when the computer went to sleep (or the screen blanked). Also, clicks on the window section of the application which was supposed to be on top, do not bring the window back to the front. I have to click on the status bar or the top area of the window (the area that lets you drag the window around the screen).

what is the state of the checkbox at the bottom of Spaces preferences? (yes it matters even if spaces is disabled... you can see the "greyed out" value)

In my case on both Leopard (iMac G5) and Snow Leopard (new MBP 13"), the box was greyed but checked. I just opened Preferences on both machines and turned on Spaces, then unchecked the bottom check box and turned off spaces. Next I pulled a non-X11 window to the front and left the machines to sleep their displays. When I came back to the iMac and moved the mouse (after a blanked screen), all the open X11 windows had moved to the front. The same X11 grabbed focus happened on the MBP when I moved my finger across the trackpad.

I did not login or reset after changing the Spaces preferences.

It is not checked. BTW, I use focus-follows-mouse.

I have disabled each of the check boxes under the Windows tab in X11 preferences, but none of those changes fixes the problem.

When I see this problem, keyboard input does not go to the X11 application. For example, if Safari was on top and active when the display went to sleep, a tab will still go to Safari even though the xterm appears on the top. The bar at the top on the xterm is greyed. Clicking on that xterm does make it active, but keyboard input is still going to Safari. Also, as I wrote above, I cannot select the active application with the mouse except by either minimizing the xterm that obscures it or clicking on the Safari menu bar area. Clicking on the window's field area or the bottom adjuster does not raise the window. Is it possible that this is a display artifact? Could it be that the X11 applications are not really where they appear to be (so far as the underlying system is concerned?

I first noticed the problem when I got an MBP with Snow Leopard and installed the final release of 2.5.0. On my G5, I never noticed it, but that appears now to be because I keep X11 windows up front most of the time, and I do not have sleep enabled on the G5 machine. I have confirmed that the error does exist on the final Leopard release of 2.5.0 (server 1.7.6). I cannot say that it was absent on the release candidates leading up to 2.5.0 because I could just have not noticed--larger screen real estate on the iMac and sleep not enabled (except for display). Even display sleep triggers it on either machine. I do suspect that it was absent from 1.4.9, and I suspect that the symptoms of other windows not recognizing the mouse clicks and another oddity that I occasionally see point to this being a display error.
\[I include the following with a warning that it is TWAG, but it does describe what I think I see.\]
I don't have the vocabulary to explain in current terms but it is like the OS has BLITted the X11 windows over the other windows an not noticed that they were drawn on top rather than underneath. While you cannot bring Word or Excel forward by clicking anywhere other than on the upper menu bar of as window, you can bring a Numbers' window forward by clicking on its "sidebar." Perhaps that tells a bit about what is going on under the hood. I suspect that the current iWork suite uses CoCoa more orthodoxly than might Office 2008. I only suspect this because Office does not seem to support things such as services.

The earliest version for Leopard that does not have this problem (but it has others) is X11-2.4.0\_beta5.dmg
X11-2.5.0\_rc1.dmg has the problem.

You skipped over a bunch of versions there. Earlier, it was reported that 2.4.0 did not have this problem.

Are we both talking about the same directory" <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/> ? I do not see anything between X11-2.4.0\_beta5.dmg and X11-2.5.0\_rc1.dmg for **Leopard**. Are you thinking of SL? Your response to Kaufman referred to files that are in the SL directory, not in Leopard's.

OK. This reply is about my Snow Leopard MBP. I installed 2.51\_beta5 (4 was broken for me). Then I tried 1.6.5-apple5 which had the same windows-to-the-front problem. And I tried 1.5.3-apple21 next, still the same error.

Another datapoint. I have a screen saver that only comes on when I move the mouse into the lower left corner. When I activate it with that gesture, and then hit a key such as shift, the screen comes back correctly.

Yes, 2.4.0 comes between 2.4.0\_beta5 and 2.5.0\_rc1, and it is in that directory. Perhaps you skipped it because the contents of that directory are sorted in alphabetical order (not release order)

Ok, so 1.5.3-apple21 has the problem, but I think 1.5.3-apple14 should be fine (since it is the one in 2.4.0). Please verify that 1.5.3-apple14 works and try finding which version between 1.5.3-apple14 and 1.5.3-apple21 causes the problem.

Due to changes in launchd support between the versions, you won't be able to test by launching the .app directly. Do the following in Terminal.app to launch X11:

    unset DISPLAY
    /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

OK, Now on SL. I installed 2.5.1\_beta5 and changed X11.bin to 1.5.3-apple18 (note that in the <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/> directory X11.bin-1.5.3-apple18.bz2 is the first of the 1.5.3 servers I could find). It exhibits the same window error problem.

On Leopard XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.5.3-apple14) through XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.5.3-apple18) I see the same failures. Xterms will also not accept any key entry in these servers and apple15 crashes at start complaining that it cannot find a proper libgcrypt in /usr/lib. I also tried apple13 with the same results. To make sure I tried starting the server in the way you listed using terminal, unsetting the env DISPLAY each time. Then I tried starting the server directly. There was no difference in the results. So, perhaps this points to something outside of the server since applw14 was in 1.4.0, and that one does not have the error.

Has anyone other than Kaufman and me reported this bug? I still wonder whether there might be some similarity between our set ups that could help track this down, Perhaps your asking on the dev list for others to see if they have the bug could help. As I said earlier, I used 1.5.0 on my iMac for a long time before I noticed the bug on my MBP a while after I got it. Then--to be honest--I didn't catch it right away. I just figured I had forgotten that X11 was actually active when the screen blanked. It was only during some intensive work in Word that I finally noticed that if any X11 window was open when the screen blanked, the X11 windows that were open would always be on top.

This leads me to believe that x11@ and I are chasing slightly different problems. Sleeping my display via mouse (to lower-right corner) and then hitting Shift will cause the screen to unblank and the Space to change to one with an xterm --- the original behavior in this ticket --- apparently what x11@ is not seeing.

Ok, this is progress then... Can you try the following on Leopard:

1.  Install 2.4.0 on Leopard
2.  sudo cp /usr/bin/quartz-wm /usr/bin/quartz-wm-2.4.0
3.  sudo cp /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib-2.4.0

<!-- -->

1.  Install 2.5.0 on Leopard
2.  sudo cp /usr/bin/quartz-wm /usr/bin/quartz-wm-2.5.0
3.  sudo cp /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib-2.5.0

<!-- -->

1.  sudo cp /usr/bin/quartz-wm-2.4.0 /usr/bin/quartz-wm
2.  Restart X11.app

Does the problem go away using 2.4.0's quartz-wm on 2.5.0? If not, try:

1.  sudo cp /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib-2.4.0 /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib
2.  Restart X11.app

Does the problem go away using 2.4.0's libXplugin on 2.5.0?

There may be a problem using 2.4.0's libXplugin on 2.5.0 (I forget if there is or not). If X11 crashes doing this, you may need to try starting 2.4.0 with 2.5.0's libXplugin to see if that introduces the problem.

No, the problem persists.

Yes! The problem appears to go away. BTW, X11 did not crash doing this.

Ok, then there is something up with the changes in libXplugin ... this gives me a place to start looking now (and hopefully create a build with logging enabled for you to try)

Can you please try a few things for me. It may help to enable the hot corners in System Preferences -&gt; Desktop & Screen Saver

1.  Does this occur when resuming from the system being asleep?
2.  Does this occur when resuming from the display being asleep?
3.  Does this occur when resuming from a screen saver?

Yes.

Yes. (This was the original bug report)

> 1.  Does this occur when resuming from a screen saver?

No. This is when the screen saver is activated from a hot corner.

Thanks, I wanted to see if this was a display sleep issue or a system sleep issue ... so it looks like it's related to the display sleep somehow... I'm bewildered, but will try to debug some more...

Can you create a new user on your account and checking to see if the issue reproduces under the new user account.

Jeremyhu,

Confirmed repeatable on every mac I've tried, 10.5.8 and 10.6.3 with XQuartz 2.5.3. It \*doesn't\* actually switch the \*active process\* to X11 - it just moves them \*in front\* of other windows.

Greg Rice

I notice that with 2.5.0 if I am in Space 6 with just Firefox.app and put the display to sleep and then come out of sleep, it will immediately switch to Space 9 which has an X11.app active (xterm). (This behavior is extremely annoying.) Other focused native apps like iTunes behave similarly.

-   **Description** modified

Doesn't reproduce here... you'll need to provide more info. I just set a hot corner for "start screen saver" and activated it with this browser in front of my X11 windows. I moved the mouse, entered my password, and when I saw the desktop again, the browser was still in front of my X11 window.

I'm also having this problem. I'm running OSX 10.5.8 on a MacBook Pro with xquartz 2.5.3 (xorg-server 1.8.2).

To ensure this wasn't an issue with my account, I did the following:

-   create a new account on the system
-   open safari for a random window to compare against
-   open terminal and confirm that ~/Library/Preferences/org.x.\* does not exist
-   start xquartz
-   ~/Library/Preferences/org.x.X11.plist now exists
-   position an X11 window behind the safari window (safari has active focus)
-   press command-option-eject to force display sleep
-   wake from display sleep
-   discover the xquartz window is in front of the safari window, even though safari still has focus. terminal is still behind safari

In case it's conceivably related, I'm using a company computer, so it's possible they installed something that interferes somehow. I don't have access to another mac to test from.

Let me know if there's other diagnostic info I can provide. I could also run a debug build if that might give clues.

Menscher,

Mine was on several company computers, too. Does my name (gregrice) appear as one of the internal e-mail addresses for your company? I'd like to see if we're working for the same company, in which case I might wonder whether this is something sticking around for just us. It's a big enough company that you really never know.

Regards,
Greg

Greg, yes, I'm the user that got you looking into this in the first place. So it could be a problem with our company image, though that wouldn't explain the others who have reported this.

After my earlier tests, I randomly discovered I couldn't reproduce this on my main account anymore, apparently because it's jumping to the screensaver immediately on display sleep. (I don't remember changing that, but macs are screwy so anything is possible.)

Given that hint, I experimented with forcing the screensaver (no problem) and having the screensaver kick in before display sleep (also no problem). So the problem only occurs when I display sleep before the screensaver. Perhaps I'm weird for wanting to do that (conserve battery very aggressively without making me type my password so often), but it does seem to be the root issue, and the way to reproduce the bug.

The good news is there's a workaround, which is to not display sleep until the screensaver kicks in. It will suck more battery, but probably be less annoying overall.

Menscher, I'd suspected you might be the person I did the ticket for, but I don't have VPN access, so I couldn't confirm.

You're right when you assert that trying to pin it down as an issue caused by our company's configuration doesn't explain the other people who've reproduced the issue, but it would give us a place to start asking questions about whether there are certain configurations for sleep we've set as defaults, or whether it's the fact that LockTight is auto-installed, etc.
****\*

So the question now, for the rest of the people viewing this bug, is whether folks like jeremyhu@ get the bug if they \*display\* sleep, even if they aren't reproducing it with \*full\* sleep.

I don't see this using hot corners for display sleep nor screensaver.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
