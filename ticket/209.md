Fullscreen switch - bogus character displayed
=============================================


When pressing alt-apple-a to switch to or from the X fullscreen display, keypress events are delivered for those keys resulting in a bogus a-ring (U+E5) character being received (on a UK keyboard; it's probably different for other languages).

To reproduce:
type "cat" in an xterm (to avoid the shell consuming the characters)
press alt-apple-a to switch out of fullscreen mode
press alt-apple-a again to return to fullscreen mode
observer two a-ring characters displayed in the xterm

(or use xev)
