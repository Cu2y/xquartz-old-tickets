xterm eat cpu and memory (for less than 10s) when redimensionned
================================================================


Every time i redimension a xterm window, for about 5 to 10 sec, my macbook is 99% cpu and xterm eat up to 1.5Go real memory (in activity monitor). This is really annoying and only happens since I installed XQuartz 2.3.2.

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?

What process is at 99% CPU?

In fact I found the reason to this, a friend of mine send me his .Xressources and it took me a while to understand that the fact he has XTerm\*SaveLines: 1000000 was definitely the reason why my xterm was working so much when redimensionning the window.

So this wasnt a bug from XQuartz and I apologize for this ticket.
