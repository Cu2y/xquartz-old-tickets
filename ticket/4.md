copy and paste proxying
=======================


Copy/Paste isn't working as expected. Paste is flat out disabled in the Edit menu.

Heh, I just started investigating this stuff myself. CLIPBOARD is in
fact proxied. I relied on this fact extensively as an NEdit user.
Ben posted the code used in QuartzWM:

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13066>

This code \*almost\* works. The only flaws I know of are a) if you use
"Copy" from the X11 app menu once then CLIPBOARD is never proxied
again, and b) it only checks for Aqua pasteboard updates on
gaining/losing focus of X11.app, so if you used pbcopy in an xterm and
then ctrl-v in NEdit it wouldn't work properly because X11 never lost
focus. You really need to poll the aqua pasteboard for reliable
results, unfortunately. \*1\*

There's really no need for the end-user to deal with CLIPBOARD vs
PRIMARY. Here's my notion of how it should work at a rather high
level. Note that we don't necessarily need to do this in the server
itself -- it should be fine to simply have a client daemon launched in
the xinitrc. Conceptually, all we need is two notifications:

-   Aqua Pasteboard changed (Event APC). Like I mentioned, this will

actually have to be polling-based.

-   CLIPBOARD changed (Event CC). It may be possible to do this as an X

client without polling, but doing so might break xclipboard and
similar apps. Google CLIPBOARD\_MANAGER to get the idea. There's a
succinct summary here: \*2\*.

What to do with the events:
On event APC, we take ownership of CLIPBOARD and PRIMARY, proxying the
Aqua pasteboard to both.
On event CC, we proxy CLIPBOARD to Aqua.

The Edit/Copy menu item in X11.app should just copy PRIMARY to
CLIPBOARD (via a private window), thus causing a CC event to be
generated. After all, that's what "copy" does -- puts the selection
in the clipboard. This doesn't need to be part of the clipboard proxy
process at all.

I don't think this should be a terribly difficult project. Given the
QuartzWM code linked above I would expect it could be done in a
weekend. I'm inclined to do it myself the next time I can find some
time.

Cheers,

I fear that we're going to need to split this into multiple tickets, because cut'n'paste is a huge complicated issue :(

Closing this as fixed. There are minor issues remaining with pasteboard integration, but those should be in separate reports. The "central" effort is now done! =)
