Unable to run Exceed on Demand Installer on OSX 10.8 wants Apple X11
====================================================================


I have tried multiple times to install Humming Birds EOD 8 client (version 8.0.2) on my Mac. I use this to access CAD Tool servers in work. When I try to run the install package it stops immediately and tells me "This Installer needs Apple X11" to run.

I have tried opening Quartz X11 and having it running then running the installer and this does not help.

This is blocking me from using and accessing my CAD tools, there are no problems with OSX 10.7 but in OSX 10.8 the Quartz X11 appears not to report to installer packages as being present.

Has anybody else experienced this bug? Are there any plans to fix it and if so is there a time line?

Right now I'm dead in the water and cant use my Mac for work at all!

Thanks for all the support

Well then Exceed's application has been broken for over 5 years. Go complain to them.

You can try briefly renaming XQuartz.app to X11.app to see if that tricks their software into working...
