xterm: changing font sizes doesn't work properly
================================================


When a terminal window is new, and you wish to use a bigger font, a control-right click brings up a menu to do the change, but the menu is not displayed properly. I must choose "unreadable" first, then do it again to select the larger font size. After the first time, it works as it should. This has occurred on all versions of the X window app from 10.2 on. XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta3 (xorg-server 1.12.0)

This bug also affects other window menus accessed by control-left click.

What about it is unreadable? It works fine for me on the first try...
