launchd throttling respawn forever
==================================


(In fact it's not a crash (seems so) but no more suitable Type for it...)

I'm using Leopard 10.5.3 and Xquartz 2.3.0

If I try to open X11.app or xterm, I will got this log in my Console again and again:
==
08-8-3 00:54:24 com.apple.launchd121 (org.x.startx) Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds
==

If I run Xquartz or startx, I can get X11.app opened, but any program that needs X11 (e.g. xterm) still won't open.

If I run the program in X11.app directly, will get:
==
fishy@Makelele:~$ /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
X11.app: main(): argc=1
Waiting for startup parameters via Mach IPC.
==

and the program hangs here, forever.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Summary** changed from *Just can't start X11.app* to *launchd throttling respawn forever*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.1*

1) Is your $DISPLAY environment variable set correctly? Please echo it to make sure.
2) X11.app is behaving correctly. It's waiting for the Xquartz stub to tell it how to start the server via Mach IPC, but that stub isn't being run (based on the launchd error message).

You need to look back farther in the log to see why launchd is throttling the respawn of startx. It does that if startx quits really soon after starting. Look in the Console's system log to find out why it's not starting correctly.

Please try out 2.3.1\_beta1 and report back. Does it work for you? Please copy the relevant debug sections from your system log (EVEN IF IT'S WORKING). See this post for more information:

I'm experiencing this same problem - or one very similar to it. I'm running 10.5.5. and the default Xserver died probably sometime around that upgrade, though I didn't pay close enough attention. As part of trying to track this down I have:

-   Installed xQuartz 2.3.1

<!-- -->

-   Reinstalled Update 10.5.5

<!-- -->

-   Reinstalled xQuartz 2.3.1

<!-- -->

-   Deleted my .Xauthority file multiple times (a suggestion I found somewhere)

If (from a clean login) I just open a terminal, remove the ~/.Xauthority file, and type 'startx', the new Xserver icon appears on the dock (nice icon, BTW) and I get the following output:

terminal:

Nothing further happens until I try to run an X app (ssh -X, xclock, or xcalc.) At this point, the app just hangs and I begin the infinitely recurring:

system.log:

    Oct  6 15:02:37 kgoudey-rv-laptop com.apple.launchd[67] (org.x.startx): Throttling respawn: Will start in 10 seconds

Any help or direction is greatly appreciated.
