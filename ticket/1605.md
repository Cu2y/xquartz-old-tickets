XQuartz cannot start after Disk Utility -&gt; Repair Disk Permission
====================================================================


Disk Utility -&gt; Repair Disk Permission sets the permission on /tmp to lrwxr-xr-x. When Xquartz attempts to start, an error occurs similar to "Could not create lock file in /tmp/.tX0-lock".

Close does not help because XQuartz attempts to automatically restart. Trying to Kill XQuartz results in an attempt to automatically restart. Attempting to Reboot results in XQuartz cancelling the reboot. Ad infinitum. The only way to break the cycle is power down through the power button.

Something might have broken my setup, but I don't have a reference implementation to examine:

    $ ls -l /
    ...
    drwxr-xr-x@  6 root  wheel      204 Oct  8  2013 private
    drwxr-xr-x@ 62 root  wheel     2108 Oct  8  2013 sbin
    drwxrwxrwx  13 root  wheel      442 Jul  1 10:37 tmp
    drwxr-xr-x@ 12 root  wheel      408 Oct  8  2013 usr

I think there are a couple of issues here. First, the inability to shutdown XQuartz and move on without the need for a hard shutdown. Second, if possible, use NSTemporaryDirectory (its not clear to me if XQuartz needs a global lock, or it can function with narrower scoped lock).

> Disk Utility -&gt; Repair Disk Permission sets the permission on /tmp to lrwxr-xr-x

Yeah. That's what it should be.

It should be a symlink to /private/tmp.

> Something might have broken my setup, but I don't have a reference implementation to examine:

Yeah /tmp is definitely not right in what you copy/pasted. XQuartz is just one of tons of programs that will bail because of that issue.

Regarding shutdown, that is behaving as designed. You could break the cycle by unloading the startx job or canceling whatever process put something in the DISPLAY socket to cause XQuartz to try to start.

Regarding XQuartz aborting because your /tmp is busted, that's also correct. We abort because your system is messed up.

You could also just reboot from the console (sudo reboot) which bypasses that whole "something running prevented shutdown" check.
