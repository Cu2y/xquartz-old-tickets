Download problem
================


I am using a MacBook Air with OS 10.10.4. and X-11 v. 2.7.6.

When I try to update to v. 2.7.7 the download gets to the extracting files stage, the blue indicator gets to the end of it's travel, then freezes. I have left it overnight, but installation makes no further progress. I have tried to upgrade 3 times with the same result.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Just download and install it manually if the updater is failing. There's nothing I can really do about that.
