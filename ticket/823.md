XQuartz 2.7.5 doesn't delete its /tmp/.X$d-lock
===============================================


I noticed this over in in ticket [\#⁠821](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/821) (which was invalid due to a misconfiguration), but the underlying problem remains:

On my iMac with OSX Mavericks, XQuartz 2.7.5 does not delete its /tmp/.X0-lock when the X server terminates. It also keeps the corresponding /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 file.

xstart then determines a new one that is still free upon the next run, so it will create a new /tmp/.X1-lock / /tmp/.X11-unix/X1. Usually /tmp is purged upon reboot, so these surplus files will be deleted then.
