xnest keys garbled
==================


If I do

    ssh -X myopensolaris gdmflexiserver --xnest

The gdm login screen's response to keystrokes is totally garbled. If I do

    ssh -X myopensolaris
    gdmflexiserver --xnest

I can get past the login screen, but something is still messed up in the terminal. The first time I type the vertical bar (shift-backslash), it does nothing. Subsequent times that I type it, I get plain (unshifted) backslashes.

On the other hand,

    ssh -X myopensolaris
    gnome-terminal

works perfectly.

    ssh -X myopensolaris gnome-terminal

also works perfectly.

Gnome likes to set the keymap. You need to tell it to not change the keymap... probably somewhere in gnome-control-panel. Ask on the mailing list and I'm sure someone will be able to help you out if that's not the right location (I'm not a gnome user).
