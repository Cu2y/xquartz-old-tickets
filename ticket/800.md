2.7.4 ignores hosts.allow in osx mavericks?
===========================================


hi. i was able to ssh into my mac osx mavericks desktop at work from home today without using vpn. this should be impossible given the configuration of the hosts.allow file, which only allows machines from within my work domain. i just upgraded to mavericks today. otherwise everything is working as far as i can tell.

This ticket has nothing to do with XQuartz.

FWIW though, you should be using pf for your firewall needs. A quick google search shows a simple tutorial: <http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/15/using-pf-on-os-x-mountain-lion>
