XScreenSaver does not work in 'root' mode
=========================================


In fullscreen mode XScreenSaver hacks do not display anything in 'root' mode. It works in 10.4 (X11 1.1.3 - XFree86 4.4.0).

To test: download XScreenSaver ; do ./configure and in 'hacks' directory type 'make kumppa'. Launch kumppa with -root parameter in fullscreen X11 session. Observe black screen, nothing happens. On 10.4 everything works.

Please try 2.3.3. There were many fixes to the window levels, so this should be fixed in 2.3.3 ... if not, please reopen

Nautilus is able to change the root window to whatever the user sets as the desktop background successfully... so this is probably something specific to your app...

xsetroot also works.. The app is kinda used all around in Unix world, it's stable as a rock more or less. It's not mine btw ;) Still it works great in 10.4. Have you tried running this exec?

I built it and ran it in 2.4.0\_rc1 in fullscreen mode:

./configure && cd hacks && make kumppa && ./kumppa -root

It seemed to work fine (the root updated) ... animation was slow, but /shrug ... it was writing to the root window.

It's one of the hacks that's supposed to be ultra fast - can you add -fps to the command line to see how much is the count. On Macbook2,1 with X11 1.1.3 - XFree86 4.4.0 I got around 30 FPS

So... your original bug said "In fullscreen mode XScreenSaver hacks do not display anything in 'root' mode. It works in 10.4 (X11 1.1.3 - XFree86 4.4.0)."

That is definitely not the case in 2.4.0, so I'm guessing I fixed this with the layer rework.

If your issue is that it is only at 7fps, then that is another issue entirely... and it's most likely a fallout from rlAccel being removed. That is something that will hopefully be addressed in a new EXA driver for 2D performance gains.
