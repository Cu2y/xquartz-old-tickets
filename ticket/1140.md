quartz-wm - XSetWMNormalHints + XWithdrawWindow cause window movement on XMapRaised
===================================================================================


When one sets in an X11 program positional hints with XSetWMNormalHints on a window and then withdraws it with XWithdrawWindow and then remaps it with XMapRaised, the window moves on mapping down the screen by the height of the quartz-wm title-bar. This does not happen if XSetWMNormalHints are not set (and also does not happen on other window managers).

To reproduce use the attached source code.
It is compiled with e.g. cc -I/usr/X11/include problem.c -L/usr/X11/lib -lX11 -o problem
If started, it will open two windows, the second window has the positional hints set.
If one pushes any key while any of the windows have the focus, both will be withdrawn and then remapped. The second one with the hints set will now start to move downward by the height of the titlebar.

BTW, sources for quartz-wm are at <https://github.com/jeremyhu/quartz-wm> ... if you can get a patch to address this issue in the next 2 weeks or so, I'll pull it into 2.7.6.

Thanks, I had a first look a at the source code. But i must admit, that code is a bit out of my league. I have not yet given up though...

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
