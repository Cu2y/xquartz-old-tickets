Yosemite 10.10.5 and Xquartz 2.7.7 Xt error: Can't open display: xterm: DISPLAY is not set
==========================================================================================


I upgraded to Yosemite 10.10.5 and Xquartz 2.7.7. When I test Xquartz by trying to open an xterm, I get

xterm: Xt error: Can't open display:
xterm: DISPLAY is not set

I restarted the computer and also reinstalled Xquartz to no avail. Please advise.

Thank you,
Paul

What's the output of these?

ls -l /Library/LaunchAgents

launchctl print user/$UID

launchctl getenv DISPLAY

echo $DISPLAY
