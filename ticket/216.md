Shortcuts work even if disabled immediately after closing preferences
=====================================================================


Immediately after closing the preferences window, the Mac key equivalents work in X11 even if they've been disabled. However, the key equivalent is also passed through to X, so I usually end up with some weird character inserted as well.

Tested in XQuartz 2.3.2\_rc4 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple29).
