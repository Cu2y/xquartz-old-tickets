Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server?
=============================================


x11 windows are missing the menu bar, while in console org.x.startx is spewing;

AUDIT: Wed Sep 23 17:09:32 2009: 4637 X: client 3 rejected from local host (uid 501)
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

.

Repeatedly. I've attached a picture and part of the log.

This is the issue:

       9/23/09 5:09:24 PM      org.x.startx[4645]      xauth:  creating new authority file /Users/snow/.serverauth.4645
    11  9/23/09 5:09:24 PM      org.x.startx[4645]      xauth:  error in locking authority file /Users/snow/.Xauthority
    12  9/23/09 5:09:24 PM      org.x.startx[4645]      xauth:  error in locking authority file /Users/snow/.Xauthority
    13  9/23/09 5:09:24 PM      org.x.startx[4645]      xauth:  error in locking authority file /Users/snow/.Xauthority
    14  9/23/09 5:09:24 PM      org.x.startx[4645]      xauth:  error in locking authority file /Users/snow/.Xauthority

You can't lock your Xauthority file, so the clients don't know how to authenticate with the server, hence connection refused on :0 (the other clients are using the launchd socket, but quartz-wm uses the traditional connection).

Why can't you lock .Xauthority? Any ideas? What type of file system is your home directory on? Can you do:

    ls -l /Users/snow/.Xauthority

Try removing the file...

ls gave me;

-rw------- 1 root staff 658 Sep 22 11:19 /Users/snow/.Xauthority

I did sudo rm on the file, reopened x11, and voila, xauth was pleased. My home is on hfs+. Odd how .Xauthority was read/write for root. I've had this problem before while using wine, perhaps there's a bug in my build.

Thanks.
