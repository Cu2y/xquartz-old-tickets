Hard crash in 2.7.5\_rc3
========================


A hard crash of X11 can be triggered by using the ds9 program (<http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/site/Download.html>), which I believe is based on tcl/tk.

Here is a way of triggering this crash: Open ds9 from the command line. Open any sub-window of ds9, for example "Analysis-&gt;Image Servers-&gt;SAO-DSS".
