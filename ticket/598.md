Crashes on start up
===================


I downloaded X Quartz for the first time. My os is 10.6.4. I tried to log out and log back into make it the default server but my Mac Book Pro seemed to hang on log out. So I did a hard reboot. When I run startx from the terminal X11.bin segfaulted. I thought it might be the installation so I ran the dmg again. Logged out and back in again. Still segfaulted.

1) You shouldn't be running 'startx' from the terminal.

2) It works fine here. You need to provide more information, like the version of XQuartz and the crash log.

3) Why are you on such an old OS version? Update to 10.6.8.
