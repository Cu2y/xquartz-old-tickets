X11 does not start
==================


I installed the latest (2.2.1) X11 package on my intel mac running leopard 10.5.2 and it just does not start when I double-click on the icon. This means I don't have any X11 running at the moment (which is quite painful). When I try to install other versions, it runs through all the install process but does not work at the end. Is there a way to uninstall everything in order to re-install the previous version?

-   **Priority** changed from *blocker* to *major*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.0*

Open up Console.app. What gets printed there when you try starting X11.app?

Open up Terminal.app. Run 'DISPLAY="" startx' what happens?

Anything past that in Console.app? Those are messages confirming that it's working... =/

Ok, well then what happens if you have no X11 running and you run 'xterm' in Terminal.app?

*slabrosse@…* commented *[on May 16, 2008](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108#comment:4 "May 16, 2008 at 9:46 AM PDT")*

Actually, the messages in the console only appear when I launch startx from the terminal. Nothing happens if I double-click on the X11 icon.

Then, when no X11 is running, typing xterm in a terminal does not do anything.

What do you mean 'does not do anything'. Does it return with an error? Does it just hang? What is the output of 'ps ax | grep X11'? What happens when you run '/Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11' at the Terminal?



---

*slabrosse@…* commented *[on May 19, 2008](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108#comment:6 "May 19, 2008 at 1:20 AM PDT")*

When I double-click on the X11 icon, it looks like it is actually starting except that I do not have access to its menu and I cannot start an xterm.
It takes a long time before in the console, the following message appears :

19/05/08 10:14:38 \[0x0-0x1e51e5\].org.x.X11\[10540\] X11.app: main(): argc=2
19/05/08 10:14:38 \[0x0-0x1e51e5\].org.x.X11\[10540\] argv\[0\] = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11

In a terminal :

-bash-3.2$ ps ax | grep X11

> 1929 ?? S 0:00.02 /bin/bash --login -c /usr/X11/bin/startx

10486 ?? S 0:00.00 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 -psn\_0\_1982948
10488 s001 R+ 0:00.00 grep X11

So it seems that it is indeed started but just not functionning the way it should.

After killing the X11 process in the terminal, I tried that :

-bash-3.2$ /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
X11.app: main(): argc=1

> argv\[0\] = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11

with essentially the same results as launching it by double-clic.

can you please 'echo $DISPLAY' in Terminal.app?
Also... looks a bit suspicious that startx is running but not the server... Can you install pstree and run 'pstree -s X11'

*slabrosse@…* commented *[on May 19, 2008](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108#comment:8 "May 19, 2008 at 7:34 AM PDT")*

When I kill startx from the terminal, a new one starts right away:

-bash-3.2$ ps ax | grep X11
10607 ?? S 0:00.02 /bin/bash --login -c /usr/X11/bin/startx
11999 s001 R+ 0:00.00 grep X11
-bash-3.2$ sudo kill 10607
-bash-3.2$ ps ax | grep X11
12009 ?? S 0:00.02 /bin/bash --login -c /usr/X11/bin/startx
12052 s001 R+ 0:00.00 grep X11

Here is the DISPLAY :

-bash-3.2$ echo $DISPLAY
/tmp/launch-k1aBUa/:0

and the result of pstree:

-bash-3.2$ pstree -s X11
-+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd

> \\-+= 00276 stephane /sbin/launchd

+= 12009 stephane /bin/bash --login -c /usr/X11/bin/startx

> > | \\--- 12050 stephane xset -b
> > \\--= 12055 stephane /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 -psn\_

Ok, so why is startx running xset? Is that in your .profile or .bashrc somewhere?



---

*slabrosse@…* commented *[on May 20, 2008](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108#comment:10 "May 20, 2008 at 9:55 AM PDT")*

yes, I had xset -b in my .bashrc to avoid beeps. Now, if I remove it, it works.
The only remaining little problem is that two X11 icons appear in the dock. It might come from all the different trials I made to solve my X11 problems. Is there something I can do for that ?

*jeremyhu@…* commented *[on May 20, 2008](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108#comment:11 "May 20, 2008 at 11:00 AM PDT")*

Same questsions. When X11 is running with the two icons, open up Terminal.app and tell me:
echo $DISPLAY
pstree -s X11

also, copy-paste all the lines pertaining to X11's startup from Console.app

What does 'echo $DISPLAY' show in Terminal.app (not xterm. This is important!)
What happens if you run 'xterm' from within Terminal.app with no X11.app running?

Well that's why. What happens when you type 'which xterm'? I'm betting its using a pre-leopard libX11 which doesn't understand the launchd socket.

In terminal, I get
which xterm
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm

while in xterm :
which xterm
/usr/X11/bin/xterm

Should I rebuild all the fink tree using the new libraries? How can I do that?
