2.7.7\_rc1 has issues with window positioning in multimonitor setup
===================================================================


I typically run with an external monitor connected to my laptop, with the external monitor positioned above the internal screen and having the system menu bar. Xquartz has worked fine with this arrangement in the past, but 2.7.7\_rc1 has got some issues. For one, it will not let me position a window with its header in the upper part of the internal screen (where the menu bar would be if it were there). Also, if I have a window in the internal screen and I click the green maximize button, the window gets enlarged to what looks like the right size, but then it gets shifted up so that its header is on the external screen. After that, if I click the green button again, it doesn't go back to its old size but is changed to fill the external screen. (This last bit might be the expected result if I'd manually moved the window to its actual position; not sure.)

I'm running on 10.9.4, if it matters.

Forgot to mention: I have “Displays have separate Spaces” turned off in Mission Control prefs.

This is likely fallout from the change that went in to address [\#⁠832](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/832). We should make that change conditional on "Displays have separate Spaces" being turned on.

This preference is in the com.apple.spaces domain, spans-displays, default value is on.

actually, default value is \*off\*. The preferences is the inverse of the checkbox.
