second xterm exits kills first xterm
====================================


This is something reproducible on my system, with XQuartz 2.3.1 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple17) and the following defaults

    {505}ardbeg:~% defaults read org.x.x11
    {
      "NSWindow Frame x11_prefs" = "322 690 478 338 0 0 1680 1028 ";
      "app_to_run" = "/usr/X11/bin/xterm";
      "apps_menu" =     (
                  (
              Terminal,
              "xterm",
              n
          ),
                  (
              xman,
              xman,
              ""
          ),
                  (
              xlogo,
              xlogo,
              ""
          )
      );
      "cache_fonts" = 1;
      depth = -1;
      "done_xinit_check" = 1;
      "enable_fake_buttons" = 0;
      "enable_key_equivalents" = 1;
      "enable_system_beep" = 0;
      "login_shell" = "/bin/sh";
      "no_auth" = 0;
      "nolisten_tcp" = 1;
      "startx_script" = "/usr/X11/bin/startx";
      "sync_keymap" = 1;
      "wm_click_through" = 0;
      "wm_ffm" = 1;
      "wm_focus_on_new_window" = 0;
    }

1- launch X11 from the dock: an xterm appears since I have "app\_to\_run" = "/usr/X11/bin/xterm";

2- open a second xterm with cmd-N (set to "xterm" in the menu)

3- close the second xterm, and the first one disappears (with eventual child windows, i.e. like emacs).

If I open the second xterm by typing the command in the first xterm, and the close it, the first remains...

I use bash & have no .xinitrc in my $HOME

The logs look like this

I can't reproduce this using 2.3.2\_beta2 ... can you please try that release. I also noticed the line in there about apps\_table\_cancel... so I'm wondering what your localization settings are... would you mind setting it to English so you have our updated .nib (sorry you don't have updates for whatever language you're using). I doubt that it would have anything to do with this issue, but I'm trying to eliminate possible differences.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Assuming this is fixed since I can't repro on newer X11 releases and no response.

Please reopen if you can reproduce this on 2.3.2\_beta2
