XQuartz install problems/error
==============================


I just upgraded my iMac to OS 10.8.3. I tried to run X11 and was informed that I needed to install XQuartz.app from your web site, which I did. However, I keep getting an install error and it tells me that I have encountered an error that caused the installation to fail and that I should contact the software manufacture for assistance. I have tried relaxing my Mt Lion software, I have checked the disk permissions, re-downloaded the XQuartz, rebooted the computer, etc. all to no avail. I can't get XQuartz to successfully install in my iMac with 10.8.3. Can you help me figure out what I need to do to get back to using my computer usefully.

There is a "problem report" that comes up when I try to open XQuartz. I'll take a screen snapshot of it and include it if possible.

XQuartz isn't starting because you are missing files (likely related to the failed installation).

Do you have sufficient disk space for the install?

Attach /var/log/install.log and /var/log/system.log after trying to install.
