Keyboard problem running XDMCP to Ubuntu
========================================


I try to run XDMCP session to linux like that:

> Xnest -query &lt;address&gt; -geometry 800x600

(actually it does not work with any geometry)
Remote greeter shows up, but when I try to log-in, I can see that keyboard is completely messed-up: e.g. pressing Backspace produces asterisk in password dialog.
My Mac OS version is 10.8.2,
Ubuntu I try connect to is 12.04.

I tried this: <http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2082272>, but it did not worked for me.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

You need to ensure that the remote client doesn't change your keymap. See if there's an option to "disable xkb" or something like that in your display manager preferences.

I tried various options with gnome settings - nothing works. I've googled to find various "pseudo-recipes" to fix this problem: nothing works. I found issue [\#⁠331](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/331) at this tracker (3 years old) - look like for three years nothing changed.
I was running various X-servers at Windows and Linux to same linuxes I try now - and I have no such problems at all. If other X-servers are able to work-around this issue, why not XQuartz?

The fact is that XDMCP with XQuartz does not work neither with Ubuntu releases that use lightdm nor with a bit older ones that use gnome.
Just enough to take Ubuntu 12.04, Mac OS X, XQuartz and try.

I (and I'm pretty sure other users) would be very graceful if you could give here exact work-around recipe how to make it work.

It works perfectly fine. The problem is that lightdm is changing your keymap.

I don't use lightdm, and it's not a bug in XQuartz. Please ask the lightdm maintainers how to configure lightdm to not set the keymap when connecting via XDMCP.
