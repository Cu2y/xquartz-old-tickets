keyboard repeat default rate 25.0/s KDE 3.5.9 does not work with 2.3.3\_rc4
===========================================================================


Using KDE 3.5.9, the keyboard repeat default rate of 25.0/s does not work. Workaround: set it up to e.g. 11.0s it works :-)

You should report this to KDE developers as well... of course they'll ask you to use kde4.

I'm guessing this is still happening with 2.5.0\_rc1, right?
