XQuartz 2.7.7 hangs in OS 10.10.1
=================================


Hello,

I recently upgraded to Yosemite, and now XQuartz won't open. It gets as far as showing a menu bar, but won't open a terminal window, and won't quit (or force quit) without restarting the computer. Similarly, if another program (Arb) calls it, it hangs. I tried opening it from the command line, as suggested here for someone else, but that led to the same result. Also uninstalled and reinstalled, no change. Any suggestions?

Diagnostics file on request.

Thanks,

Barbara

Yes, it works fine for everyone else, so please do provide a sysdiagnose taken when you are experiencing the problem.
