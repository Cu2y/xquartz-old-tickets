Button 2 generates LeaveNotify event instead of ButtonPress/ButtonRelease
=========================================================================


After upgrading to the 2.5.0 release, button 2 on my Logitech bluetooth mouse generates a LeaveNotify event when pressed instead of a ButtonPress/ButtonRelease event. Furthermore, this LeaveNotify event is only generated the first time the button is pressed. Pressing it again in the same window without moving the mouse generates no event at all.

I am running MacOS X 10.5.8 with SecurityUpdate2010-2, and I installed the X11-2.5.0 release on top of it. About X11 reports XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.7.6)

The mouse is a Logitech M-R8893 bluetooth mouse where the middle mouse button is also a scroll wheel. I am not running the Logitech MouseMan software. When I test using xev, the left button generates ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events for button 1. The right button generates ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events for button 3. The scroll wheel generates ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events for button 4 when scrolled upward. The scroll wheel generates a ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events for button 5 when scrolled downwards. The scroll wheel generates the following sort of event when pressed

LeaveNotify event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xc00001,

> root 0x481, subw 0x0, time 2963502445, (84,-22), root:(842,0),
> mode NotifyNormal, detail NotifyAncestor, same\_screen YES,
> focus YES, state 512

I did not have this problem yesterday. Since then I have applied SecurityUpdate2010-002 and XQuartz release 2.5.0 (in that order).

It turns out that I had not rebooted my system after installing XQuartz 2.5.0. The problem seems to have gone away now that I have rebooted. Sorry to trouble you; this report probably should be junked.
