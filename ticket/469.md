XQuartz 2.6.0 for Leopard Breaks IDL
====================================


When I try to use the IDL utility specpro ( <http://specpro.caltech.edu/> ) over an X11 connection the interface launches successfully but becomes completely unresponsive. What's more, the idl session becomes unresponsive, though other X11 programs still respond fine. I have to kill the process from the command line to get the computer back. It also causes the processor to spin uselessly.

Sadly, specPro doesn't seem to work with gdl (Gnu Data Language).

The computer I'm using this on is a G5 PPC running OS X 10.5.8.

Downgrading to 2.5.3 fixes the issue.

IDL version 7.0 ( <http://www.ittvis.com/ProductServices/IDL.aspx> )

-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.1*

What process is running away? Is it X11.bin or IDL?

Please capture a spindump while it is in this configuration by running 'sudo spindump'

I had the same problem using 2.6.0 on leopard (I was using IDL 8.0.1). In fact just bringing up any plot window (using the window command or a simple plot command like plot, findgen(10)) would cause IDL to be totally unresponsive after the plot window was created. I downgraded to 2.5.3 to fix this. I have since upgraded to Snow Leopord where 2.6.0 seems to work fine with IDL so I cannot troubleshoot it.

It will work fine on SL because IDL isn't using the libraries from 2.6.0, it's using the libraries from 2.3.6 and the server from 2.6.0. Please provide me with the spindump while IDL is in this state, so I can figure out if this is a bug in IDL or libX11.

i've attached a spindump of a similar problem, idl on a 2009 macbook pro core 2 duo
running the latest Leopard and XCode and idl 7.1.1 becomes unresponsive after launching
\*any\* plotting command.

Yeah, there's nothing useful in that dump since the backtrace contains no symbols... =/

Does the idl binary use the system X11 libraries? (run otool -L /Applications/itt/idl71/bin/bin.darwin.x86\_64/idl)

You may be hitting the deadlock fixed by:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/patch/?id=fd85aca7a616c595fc17b2520f84316a11e8906f>

so please try 2.6.1\_rc2 when I release it later this week.

thanks, folks,

otool -L /Applications/itt/idl71/bin/bin.darwin.x86\_64/idl

actually returns

where is libidl.7.1.dylib ? What is the output of 'otool -L /path/to/libidl.7.1.dylib'?
