Preference window not updating
==============================


I have a black Macbook which originally had Tiger but upgraded to Leopard. I updated X11 with the version from your Web site. Everything works great.

A friend has a new aluminum Macbook with Leopard and X11 pre-installed. I updated X11 with the version from your Web site, however the preference panel only had three tabs, missing Pasteboard and anonther tab (i don't remember which). Anyway, the clipboard sharing was not working on this new machine. I could see settings pertaining to the clipboard using Terminal and "defaults read org.x.x11", and i could change the values from 0 to 1, but they got overwritten as soon as i opened the X11 preferences window. The settings were there for the clipboard, but they could not be changed from the frontend.

I sort of fixed the problem by copying the main.nib file in the X11.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj from my installation to the friend's installation. Now the clipboard works, as long as the friend opens the preferences window at startup of X11. It's as is the preferences need to be called on manually for X11 to remember about the shared clipboard. There must be some other file that completes the integration of the shared clipboard which I neglected copying over from my installation.

Anyway, all this to say that the updater package does not update X11 properly. It does not update the interface file (main.nib) it seems.

Your page states:

Massive update of proxying between OSX pasteboard and X11 clipboard/primary buffers

-   Image support
-   Unicode support
-   Preference options available in the X11 Preferences window

However this X11 Preferences window did not get updated it seems.

I also forgot to mention that the problematic installation of X11 was on a french Macbook.

Yeah, the preference panes haven't been translated. If you can submit the translations, I'll gladly include them, but this is something that I can't really address personally.

I would love to, but how ? Could you guide me ? I'm fluent in French.

So, basically, this is why X11's clipboard was screwing up ? Geez, I'll be glad to help end the misery.

I think you've got my email. Send me the instructions to translate in French and I'll get on it right away.

I haven't done it myself, but it should be fairly straight forward. Make sure you install the latest XCode release.

cd /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/Resources
mv French.lproj French.lproj.bak
cp -R English.lproj French.lproj
find French.lproj -type f
open &lt;one of the files listed&gt;

The two '.strings' files should open up in a text editor and are fairly straight forward. You can probably take a look at French.lproj.bak/&lt;the strings file&gt; to copy/paste the old translations where appropriate and get an idea for how its formatted.

The .nib file will open in InterfaceBuilder. The interface is mostly intuitive and will require you to just select all the elements of the interface and change the English text to French. Unfortunately the French.lproj.bak nib is compiled and won't open up in IB (sorry, hopefully I'll get the sources for it in soon... so you might want to wait for that).

Join xquartz-dev and ask for help there if you have any trouble, and I'll do what I can.

Okay, I translated the ".strings" files... NIBs are compiled, as you said, so I can't do much on that...

The nib in English.lproj isn't compiled. You use that one as a base. (just open it in InterfaceBuilder and translate to French)

Okay, I've done it. Is there any way to test my changes ? Or do I just send the to you ?

BTW, I don't know if this is important, but InterfaceBuilder says that there are 60 errors in the nib file.

Yes, test it by running X11.app and choosing the French language.

You should fix those errors...

I don't know what on earth you're talking about when you say to choose the French language after running X11.app... How ?

And the errors are all along the lines of the screenshot i attached. No idea how to fix that... I'm not a developer :)

You choose French from your input menu (command-space)

Okay, good. I went in Sys Prefs and chose French as my language, this allowed me to test French X11. Everything was great, the clipboard wasn't working at first, but after a couple of program restarts, everything was running smoothly.

Would you like a zipped copy of my French.lproj directory to include in the next release ?

Could you open a new bug report and attach the zip there? Thanks
