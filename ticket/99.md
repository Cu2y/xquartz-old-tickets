FFM: Hovered window doesn't active on space change
==================================================


When I use control-arrow-key to switch to another Space, if the cursor is within an X11 window and focus-follows-mouse is on, I'd expect that window to acquire focus. It doesn't though. Moving the mouse even slightly will cause it to acquire focus, but IMHO I shouldn't have to do that.

Some experimentation says that the behavior is the same when using the F8 view to switch spaces, though you have to be quite careful when clicking in the view not to move the mouse, else that motion will allow focus to be acquired.

Note: this is with 2.2.1 but the "version" menu hasn't yet got an entry for that.

Further note --- it seems that after switching with control-arrow-key, not only does the window now under the mouse not have keyboard focus, but the window that was under the mouse in the previous space DOES still have focus and will receive keyboard events. That's just unalloyed dangerous, and might justify treating this as priority higher than "minor". Ticket [\#⁠98](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/98) seems to be reporting something related.

We might be able to do this my forcing a new MouseMotion event on space-change.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
