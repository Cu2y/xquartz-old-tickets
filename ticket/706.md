How to Remove XQuatz
====================


I was given an OS X application to test that required XQuarts and the app did not work. it was easy to remove the bad app but I could not figure out how to remove XQuarts under OS X 10.8.2.

Please provide an uninstaller or instructions on how to remove XQuartz

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

It's already in the FAQ.

I found it in the Utilities folder and iTrash took care of it for me

That just removes the app and leaves the rest of XQuartz. You still have the rest of XQuartz present. Please look at the FAQ

The iTrash removed the xQuartz app, org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 folder and files, three .plist files and one playlist file

The reason I used iTrash is I could not find the FAQ with the terminal commands.

Yeah, that missed the main thing ... /opt/X11 and the symlinks at /usr/X11 and /usr/X11R6
