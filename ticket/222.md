GLX: support fbconfig
=====================


According to a closed ticket <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/122> the GLX\_SIGX\_fbconfig issue has been fixed by a RC of 2.3.2. Just to be sure, I have tried all the RCs though the current build of RC5. There is still an issue. I get

err:wgl:has\_opengl glx\_version is 1.2 and GLX\_SGIX\_fbconfig extension is unsupported. Expect problems.

I have verified with glxinfo that I do have GLX\_SIGX\_fbconfig available.

I'm confused regarding this bug's status. According to the roadmap this bug is included in in milestone "OpenGL.framework DRI". However this[WineHQ](http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?p=18411&sid=d2b8a6f5f3f416f03539bba6be7f875b) forum page suggests that this bug is included in milestone 2.4. Yet still the previously closed listing for this problem, [Bug122](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/122), states it was fixed in 2.3.2 and the release version of both 2.3.2 and 2.3.1 report the same error. I've even tried using the most recent release of the 2.4 alpha and it also fails (though with a different error message so I do not know if it is a different error or not). Can someone just say what the actual status of this is, if anybody knows of course.

2.4.0\_alpha1 did not have the GLX updates. 2.4.0\_alpha2 will. Please try 2.4.0\_alpha2 when it is released (this weekend perhaps).

Excelent. Thanks for clearing that up.
