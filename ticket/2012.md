xquartz switches back to desktop by itself
==========================================


This is an odd issue that I have ignored for months but it is getting to the point of wanting me to throw my machine out of the window.

While working in full screen Xquartz switches to the OSX desktop. Sometimes it remains on the OSX desktop some other times it goes back to Xquartz full screen.
This is especially frustrating when staring at code, which literally scares the crap out of me when it switches or when typing and a bunch of keystrokes are lost since they end up being sent to OSX desktop instead.

I use Xquartz about 99% of the time on OSX so to me this is a pretty big deal :(

I have no idea why and how this happens and have not found another complaint but here it is.
