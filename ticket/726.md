Random focus loss with Xquartz
==============================


Since upgrading to 10.8.2, have been noting random loss of focus (as reported in earlier bug reports) with Xquartz. Have tried 2.7.3, 2.7.4, and 2.7.5\_rc1 - same behavior. Doesn't seem to matter what else is running (tried turning off notifications, etc.), problem is persistent.
