X11 windows on Mac second screen is not working properly
========================================================


X11 windows on Mac second screen is not working properly.

Normally happens when a projector is plugged in to a portable Mac, any XWindows that shows up on the second screen (aka projector) does not work properly. No click event is registered etc.

You need to be a bit more descriptive than that.

Did you plug in the second monitor while X11 was running? Does the issue go away if you restart X11? What version of OS X? What version of X11?

Maybe I know what the OP is referring to. If you have two-by-something windows in your dock, then the second column of windows winds up on the second monitor. However, any windows on your second monitor don't behave properly: you can't get focus in them et cetera.

Basically, every time I plug in or unplug a second monitor (or projector) I have to restart X.

What version do you have? That was fixed years ago. It's unfortunate if it regressed =/

XQuartz 2.7.4 on Mountain Lion.

Right now I have an Xserver that was started up with no 2nd monitor. I just hooked up an external monitor, and dragged a window to it. (Positioning was decidedly funky.)

In my dock, I now have 2-by-something windows. Some app is in a left window, and another in a right window. Both are visible, on my laptop & monitor respetively. Howver, I can not get the focus on the right app by moving the mouse over it. I can scroll it with the mouse, which is always possible with windows that do not have focus, but it doesn't take keyboard input.

However, if I move the right window using the dock (or a keyboard shortcut), then the "right" app shows up on my laptop screen, that is, as if it's a "left" app, and I can focus on it.

Ok, yeah... it looks like something may have regressed in this area. I'll take a look for 2.7.5.

In my previous post, change "if I move the right window" to "if I move \_to\_ the right window".

You may want to follow this for other, probably related, behaviors (of course I got here from the following link but perhaps there could be additional info that may be helpful for debugging):

Something similar happens when you enlarge an xterm into another screen. Frustratingly this worked nicely in the previous version of OSX.

This is fixed in OS X 10.9.2
