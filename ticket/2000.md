Wrong screen size with X11 forwarding
=====================================


I'm running OSX 10.9.4 with XQuartz 2.7.7\_rc2. When I manually start XQuartz.app, the dimensions in the logfile are

    x: 0, y: 744, w: 1280, h: 778
    x: 1280, y: 0, w: 1920, h: 1178

thus when I connect to a server with SSH X11 forwarding, windows are spawned on the monitor and behave as usual. However, when XQuartz is initially closed and is requested to open because I have connected to a server with X11 forwarding, the screen dimensions are initialised as

    x: 0, y: 744, w: 1280, h: 1122
    x: 1280, y: 0, w: 1920, h: 1522

and windows are able to spawn outside the physical dimensions of my monitor, so I can't interact with them correctly. The only other difference is that when X11 forwarding opens XQuartz, it seems to add the --listenonly flag, which is not present when I launch XQuartz.app manually:

    X11.app: main(): argc=2
            argv[0] = /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
            argv[1] = --listenonly

-   **Milestone** set to *OSX*

The --listenonly flag is not really relevant.

There's really nothing in rc2 that should be related to this. Did you really just see this starting with rc2? If not, what was the last version that worked?

The 'x: 0, y: 744, w: 1280, h: 1122' lines come from [PseudoramiXAddScreen](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/pseudoramiX/pseudoramiX.c#n134) which is called by [xprAddPseudoramiXScreens](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/hw/xquartz/xpr/xprScreen.c#n259)

xprAddPseudoramiXScreens provides additional useful logging which has been omitted.

Also, the height (which is the only delta here) is obtained directly from CG ... essentially:

    CGGetActiveDisplayList(0, NULL, &displayCount);
    displayList = malloc(displayCount * sizeof(CGDirectDisplayID));
    CGGetActiveDisplayList(displayCount, displayList, &displayCount);
    for (i = 0; i < displayCount; i++) {
        CGDirectDisplayID dpy = displayList[i];

        frame = displayScreenBounds(dpy);
    }

so if CG is telling us the height is 1522, that's what we're using.

Any idea why the system would have incorrect display resolutions?

Display arrangement

I observed it in rc1 as well, but I didn't notice the cause (I chalked it up to a bug in the menubar handling that had been added). I've attached an image showing my display arrangement -- maybe it's taking the total height from the bottom of the left display to the top of the right display for some reason?

Was it broken in beta1? What about 2.7.6? It would be good to narrow down which version introduced the issue.

I've found a clearer way to replicate the error (so it's not related to X11 forwarding -- maybe bug should be renamed): If I launch XQuartz from Spotlight on the left screen, the behaviour is correct. However, if I launch from Spotlight on the right screen, the behaviour is incorrect. I'm guessing this has something to do with which display is considered the "main display". The bug exists in 2.7.6 as well, although the y coordinates are different. Launched from the left screen:

    x: 0, y: 766, w: 1280, h: 778
    x: 1280, y: 0, w: 1920, h: 1200

And from the right screen:

    x: 0, y: 422, w: 1280, h: 1122
    x: 1280, y: 0, w: 1920, h: 1200

Please file a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> ... this is definitely an OS X bug that we're getting bit by. Please reference the radar number in this ticket, so I can follow it.

Reported as bug 17999906 on the Apple Bug Reporter.

In System Preference -&gt; Mission Control, do you have the "Displays have separate Spaces" enabled or disabled? Does it help to change that? (note that changing it requires you to logout and log back in).

This should be resolved in 2.7.8
