2.3.2rc2 and rc3 cannot run custom window manager
=================================================


Hello,
I'm using awesome and putting it in the xinitrc will make X11 start but never show up the window manager(replacing it with quartz-wm works). I tried recompiling it(which is necessary anyway since libpng changed) but no luck.

The problem only occurs with rc 2 and rc3. Reinstalling rc1 and recompiling awesome fixes the issue.

I tried running startx from terminal to see if there is any interesting errors showing up but nothing. The console.log doesn't look any different from the rc1 one either.

Regards,
Reza

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

It works for me using awesome from Macports.

Please ask in the xquartz-dev list if you need further assistance.
