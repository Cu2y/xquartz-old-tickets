Spaces causes Window Server crash
=================================


X11 version 2.5 running OS X 10.6.4 - window server crashes intermittently when activating spaces & you are dropped back into the login window. Crashes occur during the process of "zooming" in & out of the "all spaces" view.

system.log report from just prior to the crash & the crash log are both attached.
