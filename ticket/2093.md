In Gnome-panel or gnome-session, The Menu background get focus rendering the menu u/s
=====================================================================================


My setup.

A new installation of debian 7.5 with standard desktop settings, and newest version of Xquartz 2.7.7 on a my mac mini running 10.5.8.

Login with SSH and flag -X or -Y gives same result.

gnome-session & just gives me a black menu bar, with out function.

I can load any program I what, like nautilus & etc. but the gnome-session or gnome-panel gives a black bar, instead of a menu.

It has always been ok, and I have used my mac to control my headless server for years, and this issues is only resently.
Not sure if it has sometning to do with debian, gnome or how xquarts renders the menu panel.

I have found a reason and a work around.

After the session is loded in xQuartz, its necessary to hit \# alt a, then select under windows, bring all to front!

Then the black menu-background aka the "black bar", is pushed back and the menu overlay is brought to front.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
