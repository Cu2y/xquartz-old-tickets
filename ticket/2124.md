Terrible Cursor Lag and Window Focus
====================================


I recently upgraded to Yosemite, but xQuartz came with some terrible new problems when I tried to run Gimp through it. For one reason or another the cursor is delayed by a terrible amount behind my actual mouse movements. The other problem is that every few seconds xQuartz just loses focus on the window I was working on.

The exact same also happens for version 2.7.8 rc1. If there is a fix for this I would very much like to hear.

Focus loss is already reported and heavily discussed elsewhere. Disable whatever is stealing the focus loss for you. See x11-users and xquartz-dev lists.

As for the pointer lag, this is the first I've heard of it, but I don't really think there would be much we could do about it unless you identify what is causing the lag in your case.

I don't know what's causing the lag, that's why I'm asking you guys. I've been trying to get support on this program for months and when finally someone replies you close the topic immediately.

Also what do you mean disable whatever is stealing the focus? I have no idea what is, **that's why I'm asking you guys.**

Do you not even have any general ideas I can try? At least give me some suggestions before just giving up.

This is not a support forum. This is a bug tracking system. I've already pointed you to the mailing lists, and recent archives already provide a way for you to figure out what is stealing the focus.

If you can provide information showing that there is actually a bug in XQuartz causing the pointer lag, then we can act on it. As it is, there is nothing actionable in this ticket.

I've tried contacting those mailing lists several times in the last couple months but I got redirected away from it because they said it wasn't the appropriate place to ask. I don't know what I'm supposed to do if I keep getting dismissed for having a persistent problem with YOUR guys' application.

No, you most certainly have not. There is no reference of <pamason1129@aol.com> ever sending email to x11-users nor xquartz-dev, and in fact this exact thing has been discussed in detail multiple times on the list which is why I pointed you to the archives.
