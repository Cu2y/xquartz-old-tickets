MacOS 10.7.3 dock crash
=======================


Old problem is still with us in XQuartz-2.7.1: minimize an xterm window into the Dock, click on it's Dock icon to restore it and see the Dock crash, restart, unminimize all windows. This makes XQuartz completely unusable on my office machine for me (MacMini). Same MacOS, same XQuartz no such problem on my home machinme (oldish MacBook). Please fix. K.O.

Dock is part of the OS. It contains no code from this project.

In 2.7.2\_rc2 the problem got worse - the iconized X11 windows no longer survive the Dock crash. In the previous problem report, after the Dock crash and automatic restart, existing X11 windows were de-iconized, but still present, now they are completely gone. Mac application windows survive the Dock crash same as before. This problem is a show stopper for XQuartz - makes it completely unusable. (The original Apple X11.app does not crash the Dock, but has other problems making it useless.) K.O.

1) There is no 2.7.2\_rc2 yet

2) As I said before, this isn't a bug in X11.

Yes, right 2.7.2\_rc1, of course. And I confirm that the problem does not exist on my other Mac. I tend to think that something is messed up on the mac with the problem. I will try to figure out how to "uninstall" Xquartz without wiping the disk clean, maybe that would help. K.O.

Uninstalling XQuartz won't help the problem. XQuartz did not install anything that Dock uses, so it is not the problem. Some configs hit this and other don't. It is a bug in Lion's Dock.
