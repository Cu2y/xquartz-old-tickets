Resize Corner Issue
===================


I have the following problem. When I use X11 and Xquartz, the resize corner's unavailability is not passed on to the given application so that it doesn't try to put things there. (See pictures below.) In the nedit window, the down arrow is covered. In the xterm window, the scrollbar is covered. It would be nice if Xquartz put an unusable bar at the bottom of the window, similar to what happens when viewing the status bar in Safari. Does anyone else have a different solution?
Thanks,
Sterling

Are there any plans on how this will be handled? It would be nice to have some comments so users can give feedback.

It seems to me that it would be a quartz-wm issue, but I don't know how Xplugin works. I would rather see the quartz wm allow window borders for selected applications, but I realize that is not proper OSX style. There could also be a hot-key to hide/show the resize widget.

There are no plans to address this in Leopard nor Snow Leopard.

Lion style window resizing from any edge or corner would solve this problem.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
