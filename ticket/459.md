ssh / xauth / ForwardX11 untrusted
==================================


Having had ForwardX11Trusted set in my ssh config since Leopard, and having just downloaded XQuartz 2.6.0 for Snow Leopard, I decided to see if ForwardX11 (ie: untrusted and slightly more secure) now worked. It doesn't. I dug around on the net and found mention that xauth doesn't like the filename of the file used by XQuartz to provide the automated launch service. I confirmed that it doesn't:

$ /usr/X11/bin/xauth generate "$DISPLAY" . untrusted
/usr/X11/bin/xauth: (argv):1: bad display name "/tmp/launch-4CUcYj/org.macosforge.xquartz:0" in "add" command

But actually, the xauth that comes with 2.6.0 is OK with it. This works:

/opt/X11/bin/xauth generate "$DISPLAY" . untrusted

So it seems that ssh uses the system xauth, not the XQuartz. I found a workaround on a blog, which I adapted. I put this in my .bash\_profile login file:

if \[ -e "$DISPLAY" \]; then

> dispdir=`dirname $DISPLAY`
> dispfile=`basename $DISPLAY`
> if \[ "$dispfile" = "org.macosforge.xquartz:0" \]; then
>
> > dispnew="$dispdir/:0"
> > mv "$DISPLAY" "$dispnew" && export DISPLAY="$dispnew"
>
> fi

fi

ie: the system xauth is OK if the file is called ":0", but not if it is called "org.macosforge.xquartz:0".

This has now got rid of the annoying error message:

Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.

from my ssh logins.

Maybe you already know all about this, and don't consider it a bug, but I thought I'd share it.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Version** set to *2.5.3 (xserver-1.8)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.0*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Right, this was a bug in xauth that I fixed in verison 1.5.0 which was included in XQuartz-2.6.0

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xauth/commit/?id=135338af9a141d609e07e42208b9104465346ae4>

ssh hardcodes the location to /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth:

/usr/bin $ strings ssh | grep xauth
/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth
xauthlocation
No xauth program.
%s/xauthfile
Warning: untrusted X11 forwarding setup failed: xauth key data not generated
Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.

so if you want to get ssh to use the fixed xauth, you'll need to update /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth (either build xauth yourself or just copy the one from /opt/X11/bin to /usr/X11R6/bin)

I don't know how long it's had this, but my stock Snow Leopard 10.6.8 `/usr/bin/ssh` (which says it's "OpenSSH\_5.2p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011") lets you set the `xauth` binary location (as does jeremyhu's, by the look of his `strings` output?); I can connect without error using:

    ssh -X -o XAuthLocation=/opt/X11/bin/xauth me@remote.host

I prefer this to overwriting binaries. I hope Lion has fixed `/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth` so we can forget about it.
