X11 keeps losing focus
======================


When using an X application, the window spontaneously loses focus, although X itself remains the current application. I know people have had this problem before when also running apps that, for example, probe iTunes for current playing song, but I'm not running anything that is doing anything like that (that I know of). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have the same issue, on two different platforms (both 10.5.4). I'm also not running iTunes (or last.fm).

Focus is lost at 60 second intervals, at exactly the same time (for example, at time 12:52:XX, where XX is always the same).

This does seem to be a new issue for me, in the last few days, although it happened with 10.5.3 also.

I tried X11-2.3.0\_rc4.pkg and have the same problem.

So at least for my case, the offending application is ARDAgent. This app runs if you have System Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Remote Management checked (which you might do if you're trying to defeat a security issue 10.5.X currently has). After unchecking this, X11 no longer loses focus unexpectedly. Are you running ARDAgent, erniefourman?

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.3.0* to *2.3.1*

I am running ARDAgent, but I'm not seeing this. Do you need to have any specific options enabled or disabled? I had a hunch that this issue would be fixed due to some changes I made in 2.3.0... so I'm really confused about what might be causing this.

Yes, I did have ARDAgent running because of the security issue - Remote Management turned on but no options selected and set to "Only these users" with no users listed. I had noticed that in console I was getting a log message exactly once per minute from ARDAgent about a stray process with the same pid. This coincided with the loss of focus in X11. I'm not sure what has happened in the mean time, but now I'm not getting these problems from ARD and the focus issue hasn't recurred since.

Ok, so I'd turned ARDAgent off because of the annoying console messages. Turned it back on and restarted, and the focus loss is back.

This is a dupe of [\#⁠58](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/58).
