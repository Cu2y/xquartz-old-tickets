New Mavericks update causing games to not load properly
=======================================================


Looks like the most recent Mavericks update that went out today made some Mac compatible Steam games stop working. Specifically Shadowgrounds: Survivor. All I get is a black screen. Using the most current stable version of XQuartz 2.7.7. On Mavericks 10.9.5

It said something about logging out before it would work when I installed 2.7.7, but not sure what it was refering to so I just restarted my computer. Still nothing.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Not sure what that has to do with XQuartz...

Contact Valve.
