Deadlock in the OpenGL lib
==========================


According to Alexandre Julliard:
"There's a deadlock with the display lock somewhere in the OpenGL lib. That's an
Apple bug."
More info can be found at the end of this bugreport:
<http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10184>
To reproduce it is enough to compile wine with OpenGL support.
Then set up LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/X11/lib and run:
winecfg or any other wine/windows app.

Now I start to think that it is not only OpenGL related. After installing version Xquartz-2.1.4 the OpenOffice.org 2.1 (don't know if other versions also react in the same way) stopped working. It just informs me that command did time out.
