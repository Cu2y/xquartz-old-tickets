clipboard gets erased when changing windows
===========================================


this only happens when "Focus on New Windows" is on. The note from developer of wingide says-- "This seems to be a bug in XQuartz -- if I turn off the Focus on New Windows preference in the X11 Preferences (under the Windows tab) the bug goes away. I also don't see it on older X11 (w/ OS X 10.4) or on Linux. Since people can download and try Wing for free, I don't see it as an issue that this is the only place you've seen the bug. It could be that our popup in this case is somehow the wrong window class or something, but OTOH it still doesn't make sense that XQuartz would blow away your clipboard when changing windows. The developers will probably know what it is, and what to do."

The recreate:

-   somewhere outside wingide, copy some text using cmd-c
-   ctrl-space (to mark)
-   down space (to select one line)
-   ctrl-w (to cut/yank selected text)
-   ctrl-shift-minus (to undo)
-   ctrl-y (to paste, and verify what should be in the buffer)
-   ctrl-f (to bring up file selection)
-   tab (to bring up tab complete)
-   ctrl-g (to cancel)
-   ctrl-y (to paste, and see that it pastes something different)

What version of X11 are you using? You did not set that properly in the bug report below.
Focus on new windows will have no effect on copy/paste ... especially if this is a pure X11 application.
Please install 2.3.2\_beta2 (<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads>) if you haven't already and see if the problem still occurs. If it does, try disabling the X11/OSX pasteboard synchronization in the X11 preferences.

You also might get better response by joining the xquartz-dev mailing list.

FWIW, the reporter said earlier (via our support discussion) that he has XQuartz 2.3.1 on Leopard 10.5.5 and there's a typo in his list of how to reproduce it: "ctrl-f (to bring up file selection)" should be "ctrl-x ctrl-f". Also you would need to go into Preferences in the Edit menu and set the Personality under Keyboard to "Emacs" first. I'll leave it to him to try 2.3.2 beta2. I was using the even older 2.2.3 in my own tests.

This is a problem I'm not sure how to solve. We really need to receive an event of some kind when the NSPasteboard changes (for the implementation of xpbproxy). The NSPasteboard documentation states we should be able to receive such a thing.

At the moment we check if there was a change to the pasteboard when switching windows, which is a less than ideal solution, that generally works.

See:
<http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSPasteboard_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/pasteboardChangedOwner>:

However, I couldn't get that to work for some unknown reason. I will try to contact the NSPasteboard developers and see what they say.

I think this is the bug where ew don't proxy complex types in the CLIPBOARD.

Does the problem go away if you turn off the preference, "Update Pasteboard when CLIPBOARD changes"?

14 months without an answer to my question. I'm closing under the assumption that this is the complex-types proxy issue.
