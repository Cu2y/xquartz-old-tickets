FFM: Odd focus changes when OSX windows are interleaved with X11 windows
========================================================================


Jeremy,
This is the bug report you requested in your post to <x11-users@lists.apple.com> (msg-id: &lt;<5CFCFFE2-0D8F-47FE-A3BB-E99B014406DF@apple.com>&gt;)

**This part of the bug is fixed in 2.3.2beta1 xorg-server 1.4.2-apple20:**
*X11 windows used to gain focus when the mouse moved over them while they were obscured by an OSX window (e.g. Safari) which was the frontmost window.*

**The following still occurs (with 2.3.2beta1 xorg-server 1.4.2-apple20):**
*The effect is only visible with wm\_ffm true.*
Focus moves to partially obscured X11 windows only when X11 is the topmost application. If the X11 windows are interleaved with OSX windows with X11 in the foreground (e.g. xterm has focus and is topmost; Safari is next and partially obscures another X11 xterm), if I move my mouse out of the top xterm and over the Safari window (without raising Safari), then the xterm beneath the Safari window receives focus whenever the mouse hovers over the area that it occupies which is beneath Safari's window. However, I believe that is how the system has to work. On the other hand were OSX to support FFM for all applications, then I suppose this would not be correct behavior.

So this is not really a bug (I guess), and I do like the fact that I can interleave OSX and X11 windows (which way back was not possible). I would not wish to give up the interleaving. However, the focus is a bit distracting and may point to something under the hood which is not working as planned.

Replying to [x11@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/185):
This may not be part of this same bug, but it's similar behavior. When another application is active (say Firefox in my case) and I move the mouse around with FFM enabled for X11, I can see the focus in the background changing as the mouse moves over X11 Windows (even if they are partially obscured by the Firefox window). Shouldn't that movement not affect which X11 window is focused unless X11 is in the foreground?

I guess it's not a critical problem, but it's a bit disconcerting when I'm using a completely different application seeing the focus for my X11 windows changing.

If I should submit a new bug for this, let me know.

That other issue should not exist in the 2.3.2 rcs

Sorry, I should have mentioned that the problem I reported (focus changing on X11 Windows when another application is active) was in 2.3.2\_rc3.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
