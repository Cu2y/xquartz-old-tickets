xInput: support pressure sensitivity.
=====================================


pressure sensitivity is working in linux, but not OS X: X11.
I've struggled for some years to understand and find out who might sort this for OS X.
I believe Frederic Lepied &lt;<lepied@xfree86.org>&gt; developed the original patch
continued by Owen Taylor&lt;<otaylor@gtk.org>&gt;
Ping Cheng &lt;<pingc@wacom.com>&gt; appears to be the contact at wacom
wacom and adobe illustrator provide pressure sensitivity support in OS X using (cocoa?).

these individuals should be able to give you all necessary advice regarding a patch.

I hope this is sufficient and useful, please let me know if any further assistance is required

kind regards

I gave my tablet to Ben to work on this. The 1.4 server has initial support for it. Please join xquartz-dev if you'd like to be kept up to date or help out.

-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

I'm closing this as fixed. xinput is showing the pressure being reported. gtk isn't using that information, but gtk is beyond the scope of this project, and we've made ample effort to get information from them regarding what we might need to do differently. As far as I can tell, this is now a gtk bug. Should gtk developers require us to do something different to make it easier to get the pressure and tilt, I'd be more than willing to make those changes.
