capslock set as control not working
===================================


With the latest xquartz update, I get inconsistent behaviour when using the capslock key for control. It will often start out working, then start working like capslock. This behavior is limited to the X applications.

Oh, and when the capslock starts acting like capslock (it should be acting as the control key as I've set it in system preferences), the left control key starts acting as a control key as well.

No, this can never work. Your best bet is to remap capslock and control for OSX in System Preferences. It can't work at the XQuartz level due to how capslock information is passed to the application. We just know if it is on or off, not if the button is up or down.

I apologize for not making this clear. I have set capslock to act as control in the OSX System preferences, and it has been working for 2+ years; however with the most recent xquartz update, capslock and the left control act as capslock in the X windows, while they act as control everywhere else.

I was using the beta version 2.7.2\_3, and I have re-installed the stable version 2.7.1, and it is now working correctly.

Nothing has changed in that logic in the past 2+ years. XQuartz knows absolutely nothing about the physical placement of control and capslock. We are simply told by AppKit that capslock is on or off and that l-control is either active or not. We're just responding to the bitmask that is handed to us by AppKit. If this isn't working correctly, then it is a bug in AppKit or something else in that stack. This is not an XQuartz bug.

Hi Jeremy,
I found the cause of this problem... as it wasn't really resolved by re-installing 2.7.1 . The switch comes about when I ssh into a linux machine that swaps the ctrl and capslock functionality by executing 'xmodmap .xmodmap' in the .bash\_profile with the following in .xmodmap:
!
! Swap Caps\_Lock and Control\_L
!
remove Lock = Caps\_Lock
remove Control = Control\_L
keysym Control\_L = Caps\_Lock
keysym Caps\_Lock = Control\_L
add Lock = Caps\_Lock
add Control = Control\_L

... It would be great if I could still have this on the linux machine... and thanks for clearing things up.

Sorry about the formatting, here is a better version.

    !
    ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
    !
    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
    remove Control = Control_L
    keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
    keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
    add Lock = Caps_Lock
    add Control = Control_L
