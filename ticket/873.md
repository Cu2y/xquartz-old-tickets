Toggle fullscreen grayed out
============================


Hi!

Im using XQuartz to run MetaTrader 5 on my MountainLion system. XQuartz has the latest version (2.7.5).
I have the problem that I can not run the program in fullscreen mode, cause in the Menu, the button "Toogle Fullscreen" is grayed out.
In the settings of X11 the outout Fullscreen Mode is also enabled. Can you please help me to get the application run in fullscreen mode?
That would be very very nice!

Here is a picture of the "error": <http://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2014-01bou49.png>

Thanks in advance!

The toggle item is only available if you're in fullscreen mode.

You can enter a fullscreen RandR mode from your application, or you can use X11 in fullscreen and use that shortcut to toggle "in and out of X11"
