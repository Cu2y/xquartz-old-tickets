X11 crash
=========


X11 Version: 2.5.1\_rc1 (2.5.15) -- downloaded 21 Jun 2010 at 10:30AM EDT.
Crashed with unremarkable provocation. Opened up an emacs window from a remote machine; I noticed that the cursor was corrupted \[a seemingly random series of dots) whenever it was in the emacs window. Clicked on the title bar of the emacs window to see if that would clear it, and got the spinning beachball of death, and then crash reporter popped up.
Crash report attached.

Possible complication: I have a two monitor setup, and the emacs window was on a different monitor from where the X11 was started.

Unfortunately, there's not much present in that crash report that would be helpful. Can you look in /var/log/system.log and report entries leading up to the crash?

ugg... stupid trac not emailing on file attachment...

Is this still happening with 2.5.1\_rc2?

Are you able to reproduce it reliably?

Sorry, I had reverted to 2.5.0.

Just tried to get the 2.5.1\_rc2 for Leopard (this is a PPC machine),

> but apparently it doesn't exist yet (only for Snow Leopard?)

(only the 2.5.1\_rc1 is in /xquartz/downloads/Leopard/)

You don't have a SL system to try it on?

No, this is NOT fixed in the final 2.5.1 release.
I tried again, again it crashes.

-   Crash is consistent. Tried three successive times, all tries ended in crash.

<!-- -->

-   Tried creating windows on two remote systems:

1.) Irix 6.5.30 created X windows (xterms & emacs) without apparent complaints
2.) linux 2.6.18-92.1.22.el5 [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1) SMP Tue Dec 16 11:57:43 EST 2008 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

> --- either creating a remote emacs session or a remote xterm from this machine will eventually cause a crash.

I've attached the (annotated) system.log file that reports the first crash.
I am reverting to 2.5.0, as this release is useless on this PPC/Leopard machine.

Can you please provide more information? The log is showing double frees in malloc... can you please give me a backtrace of when that happens?

    malloc: *** error for object 0xa9f400: double free\n*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

Please attach to your running X11.bin with gdb or start a new X11 within gdb:

    $ gdb /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
    (gdb) break malloc_error_break
    (gdb) run
    ...
    X11 runs as normal until the error happens and you are returned to a prompt:
    ...
    (gdb) bt
    send me the results of the 'bt' command

Thanks. This is now fixed in git. You can find an X11.bin with the fix here:
