xterm windows change color after being moved
============================================


I have been running the standard Snow Leopard X11, and it does not exhibit this problem. I installed the latest xQuartz, 2.5.2, and started to see this problem. I create an xterm and specify a background color:

> xterm -geometry 80x60+600+0 -bg palegreen

and the window comes up with the right green color, just like it did under X11. As long as I don't move the window, everything is fine. However, once I move the window, all new things that get displayed in that window have a lighter shade of green. If I take the window and drag it off the screen and back on, the part that went off the screen gets changed to the lighter shade of green. If I take another window and drag it over the green window, the areas where it passes over it get changed to the lighter shade of green.

I've also started up an xterm on a remote linux system, and the same thing happens, the window comes up with the right shade of green, but if I move it it then starts to change color to the lighter shade of green.

This isn't just this particular color, it happens with most colors I try. The only exceptions I've found that seem to be immune from this behavior are green, red, magenta and cyan. Both yellow and blue exhibit the behavior. In addition, other shades of those 4 colors do exhibit the problem.

I can also see it with simple numeric colors, for example:

> xterm -bg '\#ff0000'

shows a red screen without the issues, but they may still be there, just not visible. As I progressively try slight variations, .e.g \#fe0000, \#fd0000, \#fc0000, \#fb0000, \#fa0000, and so on, the issue starts to be come more an more visible. For example, at \#fa0000 the issue is barely visible, but at \#f00000 it is easily visible.

Since I have not run any of the xQuartz servers since Snow Leopard, I do not know when this regression first happened.

I'm attaching a screenshot showing the original palegreen issue.

Some more experimenting shows that this problem does not exhibit itself for shades of gray, i.e. for any color value where the RGB values are the same, e.g. \#b0b0b0
