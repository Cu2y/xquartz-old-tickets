cmd + ~ breaks x11 (in particular it hangs all xterms)
======================================================


Both the latest Apple update and a subsequent install of XQuartz 2.5.0 suffer from this bug.

Cheers,
Tudor

Removing X11 and instead using XQuartz fixed the issue.

Your comment does not make sense. You said that the latest X11 and XQuartz-2.5.0 suffer from this issue, then you followed up saying XQuartz-2.5.0 does not suffer from this issue.

I don't see any issue with cmd-\` or cmd-~ in either 2.3.5 or 2.5.0.

Please clarify.

I experience this problem when using XQuartz 2-5.0 and the latest Apple update.

However, the problem does not occur when when I use XQuartz from an newly created account on my machine. This leads me to believe the issue is related to some interaction between the 10.6.3 update and some third party software or customization on my machine.

I apologize I was not sufficiently clear. First, the update from apple broke X11 in the fashion I mentioned. Then, I installed XQuartz 2.5.0 in the hope I would get rid of the problem---I did not. Subsequently I trashed (rm -fr) the /Applications/Utilities/X11 and /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz and re-installed XQuartz, at which point the problem vanished.

T

I have more information to offer on how to reproduce the problem:

The problem only occurs for me if the "Enable key equivalents under X11" option is disabled from the System Preferences/Input tab.

If I enable this option, using the cmd-\` key does not cause a hang.

It's not a hang. Input events just aren't being delivered.

In any case, input events are delivered until I press cmd-\`. After that, none of the windows I have open (xterm, emacs, etc.) will accept any input.
So, it appears hung to me.

Right. I understand it is a bug, and it puts you into a state where you cannot interact with the program, but I'm providing diagnosis detail and clarification for my benefit later.

The fix will land in the first alpha for 2.5.1, and you can get it here:

<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/quartz-wm-PR-370.bz2>

just download that and replace /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm with it after decompression.

The patch that I bisected this issue to in the server actually fixed a real bug that was discussed at length in October, and by fixing that, we actually revealed a bug in quartz-wm! &gt;&lt;

The patch works, but I am no longer able to input a tilde (~) or backquote (\`) into a window.

CMD+~ and CMD+\` should cycle/reverse-cycle through open windows.

Now, ~ and \` cycle/reverse through open windows as well.

Hmm... that's no good.

Yep... and before you could only cycle one-way.

yeah... that's not so good. I think I missed a check in there for the cmd-modifier. my bad. gimme a few.

ugg. That's because I have 2.5.1 runtime right now. &gt;&lt;

I'm tired of this. Please just revert to the 2.5.0 version. I'll have a 2.5.1\_alpha1 out sometime in the next week or so which will have the fix.

With XQuartz 2.5.1\_rc2 I'm seeing behavior similar to what michaelawells described (` acts like Cmd-` instead of inserting a \`, and the same with ~), but only \*after\* changing the xmodmap in a specific way. Here's the simplest test case I can produce:

1.  Start XQuartz, with no .Xmodmap file.
2.  Bring up a second xterm. Press ` to verify that you do get the ` character.
3.  Run: xmodmap -e 'clear mod2' Press ` to verify that you do get the ` character.
4.  Run: xmodmap -e 'keycode 90 = KP\_0'
5.  Press ` and it will switch windows instead of inserting a ` character.

It doesn't seem to matter what keycode I assign in step 4. It \*does\* matter which mod I clear in step 3; only clearing mod2 (Meta) seems to produce the behavior, probably because Cmd-\` is using the meta key. I have tried various combinations of “Follow system keyboard layout”, “Enable key equivalents under X11”, “Option keys send Alt\_L and Alt\_R”, and they don't seem to affect this behavior.

Ugh; this is hitting me too. It happens with 2.5.2 release on 10.6.4.

Specifically:
1) I do not have Enable Key Equivalents under X11 checked.
2) When I hit CMD-\`, it stops input to all windows.

As an emacs user, having M-w (copy) morph into CMD-w (close window) isn't fun.

Let me know what I can do to help diagnose.

Try with 2.5.3 when it is released which has the fix for the missed corner case.
