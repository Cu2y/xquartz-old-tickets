X Error: BadWindow (Major opcode: 131)
======================================


Hi All,

I am using Xquartz in MAC OS 10.6.8. I am trying using some remote application from Sun server through Xquartz. Unfortunately, it crashed whenever I try to launch that application. The name of that application is Silvaco Atlas (Tonyplot3d). I am attaching herewith some symptoms and log files.

Please let me know if anybody have any suggestion or update. I am using SSH -Y <username@servername.edu> command due to remote login in that server.

please check rest of the log files.

PS. I have already installed OpenGL and Xcode properly.

Sincerely
Sumon Dey

Your application (running on the Sun machine) is crashing, so there's nothing I can really do about that. There may indeed be a bug in XQuartz which is contributing to the problem, but the application's crash should be reported to the Tonyplot3d developers.
