Paste does not function
=======================


I was told on \#xquartz by geekosaur that someone (Jeremy?) is looking for debugging info from those of us having trouble with pasting in xquartz on 10.8. The standard middle-click / option-click does nothing. I don't think I have any other clipboard manager running, or at least not any more than I was on 10.7 with X11. I upgraded to 10.8 while migrating to a MacBook Pro retina. I had some trouble with the migration in terms of moving other software, I think in part due to root-access issues -- things that were installed by root didn't go from my old computer to my new one. Not sure if that is related.

Just acquired a new iMac with Mountain Lion installed. Downloaded XQuartz and find I have the same problem! In fact, used to be able to just highlight some text and with option-click could also just paste it at my insertion point without first doing copy, but now no longer. Anyway, with command-c can copy to the Apple clipboard and paste into other applications such as TextEdit, but as with the author of this ticket cannot paste into anything open in my X11 window.

Should, of course, have added that the version of XQuartz I downloaded is the latest, 2.7.3.

Richard, do you actually have "Three button mouse emulation" enabled? Option-click doesn't do anything on its own. Middle click does, and you need to enable the emulation to make option-click a middle click...

Hi Jeremy, replied to the email, but clearly need to do it here! Thanks very much for your suggestion. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have this possibility with the Apple Magic Mouse. Nothing in the mouse preferences about a middle click.

It's not in MagicMouse's preferences. It's in X11's preferences.

Thanks. Things are now back to normal. Had thought that the default for my X11 preferences would have been the same as before. But, with Mountain Lion refusing to install X11 automatically and, thus, necessitating a completely new install of X11, I had not thought of checking them. Anyway, problem is solved for me. Did that also solve the problem for goldston@…? Again, many thanks. Dick.

Hi all ,
Pasteboard settings in X11 preferences do not solve my problem. I can copy selected text using right click or from edit menu on X11 windows (e.g. nedit) and paste it on OSX iTerm2 or Terminal windows using cmd+v or right click popup window. It also works other way around, but I cannot simply do copy-paste using the middle click between X11 and OSX. Middle click copy-paste works fine between or inside windows of Terminal or iTerm applications. I do not what I have done but it was working a few days ago. I have Mountain Lion (10.8.3) and Xquartz 2.7.4 (I tried 2.7.4 as well)
I would be very happy for any hints.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

The middle-click support in iTerm and Terminal are features within those applications. They have nothing to do with the NSPasteboard.
