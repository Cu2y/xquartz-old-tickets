soft links in /opt/X11 wrong owner
==================================


Hi - I've just noticed that the files installed in by XQuartz 2.6.2 that are soft links, have an owner of uid=501. All other installed files are owned by root. These are found in the /opt/X11/bin, /opt/X11/include, and /opt/X11/lib directories, as installed on a Mac OS X 10.6.8 system.

I suspect this is a simple oversight in the postflight script, where perhaps a "chown -R" type of command is used. If one uses a "chown -Rh" instead, all regular and soft link files will have the ownership changed.

a minor issue, but easy to fix, I suspect.

That's a bug in Package Maker.app
