Installation Wipes-out paths.d directory
========================================


After running this installer, I found that my PATH variable is missing several important directories. Looking into this further, I find that any of the custom entries that were placed in the /etc/paths.d directory were wiped-out. The only one in there now is the one for 40-XQuartz. This has really hosed-up my system.

You are mistaken. The XQuartz installer does not do anything to /etc/paths.d other than drop in 40-XQuartz.
