Website
=======


Hello,

I have been trying to download X11 from your site but unfortunately I haven't been able to as the downloads don't respond. I have tried in 3 different browser that are in the version most up to date: Safari 5.2, Google Chrome 18.0, and Opera 11.63.

Thank you for your help,

Clement

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

Outage? Either way, not a bug.
