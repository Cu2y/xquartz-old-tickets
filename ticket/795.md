Window behaviour on multiple monitors under OS X Mavericks
==========================================================


On a multiple-monitor Mavericks install, X windows disappear when I attempt to move them between screens.
Additionally, I can not expand a window to the full size of the screen where the window does appear.

Not a bug we can fix in XQuartz. File a bug at <http://bugreport.apple.com>

Other applications work well and can be moved between displays. XQuartz 2.7.5\_rc2 has the same problem by the way.

Yes. I am aware of the issue. Please file a radar. This is not an issue that is solvable solely within XQuartz.

Sure, I can file a bug report with Apple, but what in particular can I say that won't cause them to just close the ticket and say it's an application problem?

Just indicate that it is a regression from Mountain Lion seen with X11. You can report the ticket number here, and I'll make sure it's routed right.

Thanks.
