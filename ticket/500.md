Caps\_lock on hold sends immediate KeyPress / KeyRelease
========================================================


Caps\_lock immediately sends a KeyRelease when held.

This makes it impossible to use it as a 'control' key.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

1.  Launch xev
2.  Focus the event window
3.  Press and hold Caps lock. Observe the KeyPress / KeyRelease events (example attached)

-   **Resolution** changed from to *wontfix*

Yes, unfortunately there's no way around this because we don't get NSEvents for the individual press/release. We are just told by AppKit when the status of CapsLock changes (on/off) and from that need to send an up/down for the change.

A workaround can be to change it in the system preferences instead. I've done so happily.
