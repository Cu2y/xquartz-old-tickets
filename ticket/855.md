Installation bug version 2.7.5
==============================


This is very minor, but when I was installing XQuartz 2.7.5, and clicked on Read License, nothing happened. While I realize that most people don't ever actually read the license(s), it's nice not to have to search the site for the information.

I was installing this on a MacBook Pro running OS 10.7.5.

thanks

Works for me (see screen shots).

The license is included in the installer and is shown to everyone at installation time.

The "Read License" button just closes that dialog box without progressing to the next step of the installer (to go "back" to letting you read the license which is already on screen). In order to even show the "Read License" button, you have to have seen the license.
