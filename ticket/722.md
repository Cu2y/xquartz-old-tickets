X11.app on OS X goes into crash/restart loop; doesn't stop until logout
=======================================================================


Whenever I start X11.app, for whatever reason, be from starts, xinit, being invoked by launchd, or even by double-clicking in the /Applications/Utilities folder, the X server crashes with the following error message:

An error occurred while starting the X11 server: Cannot open log file /Users/username/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

Upon clicking Quit or report, the application quits, only to reopen a few seconds later with the same error. Killing the X processes with killall -9 from Terminal doesn't stop this. Interestingly, X was originally trying to copy that log file to /Users/username/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log.old, and got caught in the same loop. When I deleted the file, the error persisted, this time with the above message.

It appears that the /Users/username/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log file is owned by root, and even after chown-ing it to my user account, the bug never fixed itself. It does appear to be an issue with my user account, however, as when I log in as root from the OS X login window X has no problems running.

I'm running OS X 10.8.2.

There is no X11.app on OS X 10.8.2 ... do you mean XQuartz.app?

Please attach your logs.

Why is your log file owned by root? Did you try launching it as root? How are you launching X11?

Please attach your logs.

Yes, sorry, I did mean XQuartz.app. And, I can't attach my log because I deleted it. Simply, it was originally complaining about not being able to rename the log, as I stated above, and so I deleted it to try and see if that would ameliorate the issue. Then it complained about the file not being present. There really wasn't anything too important in there and no error messages or warnings.

No idea why my log file is owned by root. I suspected it was when I tried to rename and then delete the file from the Finder and OS X asked me for my password... I run as an administrator so I should have access to all files on the drive. I then did a chown of the file to myself, but no avail. I deleted the application preferences and caches and it still wasn't working. I did not attempt to run the application with sudo or su, but when I log in as root everything works fine. Haven't tried the guest account but I presume that will as well. I'm primarily launching X11 by the XQuartz.app bundle in the /Applications/Utilities folder. But the same issue also occurs when I use an X11 dependent app from the command line (xeyes, etc) or when invoked by launchd ( i.e when required by wine).

I require X support to do day to day work and this bug is severely restricting me. Any help in alleviating the problem would be much appreciated.

What \*exactly\* have you done?

What \*exactly\* is happening right now?

Your comments are scattered, and it's difficult to understand what you are doing and what is happening. Please try to explain and provide logs where possible. I understand that you are having issues, and I want to help you. As a word of advice though, nobody else is having problems, so it is more likely a configuration issue, and you may get faster turnaround by asking on the x11-users mailing list.

Please do the following:

1) Reinstall XQuartz.

2) Create a new user account and try launching XQuartz.app as that user.

3) Assuming the above worked, log back in as your original user and try launching XQuartz.app. If it fails, provide logs (/var/log/system.log, ~/Library/Logs/X11, etc).
