XQuartz does not work with multiple monitors in Mavericks
=========================================================


Hi,

My config is a Retina MacBook Pro running Mavericks with XQuarts 2.7.4. The external monitor is both physically and logically above the laptop monitor.

An X11-app is trying to spawn itself in the center of the combined monitor. Only the half on the laptop window appears. It is not just a rendering issue: there is no window on the external monitor, and any clicks fall through to the desktop, etc.

This of course means I can't move the window, so I can't put it on a single monitor. Any attempt to move the window via Mission Control causes the window to disappear completely (though it still shows in MC).

The window appears if XQuartz starts with no external monitor. However, connecting the external monitor causes the window (even though it was completely on the laptop screen) to disappear. MC still shows it as being on the laptop menu, but there is no way to see it until the external monitor is disconnected, at which point it magically reappears.

XQuartz's Full Screen Mode is disabled. Enabling the feature (in Preferences) with the external monitor connected does nothing; activating it causes the external monitor to go all black. Enabling the feature with no external monitor causes the X11 app to disappear until the feature is activated.

Thanks for listening!

Seeing same here, 21" iMac, Late 2012 version. Using Xastir, will only show on main monitor. When I try to move window to secondary (Mini Display Port/Thunderbolt-&gt;DVI adapter) display window goes off the edge of screen.

If I launch Xastir while cursor clicked on second monitor (bringing menu bar on second monitor to front), Xquartz/X11 menu shows on second monitor. However Xastir window shows on main monitor and still won't move to second monitor.

However, if I three finger swipe (expose') I can grab the X11 screen and move it to the second monitor (labeled desktop 2). I can live with this but it would be nice to just drag and drop.

I think this might be a function of how second monitors are handled with the new OS. Standard windows are transparent while moving to the second monitor until they are completely over in the new window.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

File a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> ... this isn't something that can be addressed solely within XQuartz.

Came across this from the Ars Technica review of Mavericks:

*Well, perhaps not all of us. If you prefer the old behavior, uncheck the "Displays have separate Spaces" checkbox in the Mission Control preference pane. Doing so will also restore the ability to have windows that span more than one display.***'
**

This should return your desktop to the way you expect it to behave.

Yes, that is a valid workaround, but the actual fix is something that requires a change in OS X.
