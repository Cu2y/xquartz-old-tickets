Wrong menu bar displayed when switching to X11
==============================================


Sometimes when switching to X11 via the Apple-TAB application switcher, the menu bar for an application other than X11 gets displayed.

Here’s what I’ve been able to discern:
1) I have multiple spaces. Things like Mail, iTunes, etc are in Space 1. All my X windows are in Space 2.
2) I use Apple-TAB to switch between applications.
3) While in space 1, when I switch to X11, \*and\* X11 is not the second item in the tab list, it will switch to Space 2, put focus into one of the X11 windows, but sometimes give me the wrong application menu bar. Clicking on the menu bar puts me into that application. Otherwise, if I type Apple-TAB again and select X11 again, it switches to the X11 menu bar.

It doesn’t ever seem to get confused when X11 is the previously used app, i.e., it is second in the Apple-TAB list.

I also haven’t been able to discern a particular pattern, other than X11 has to be at least the 3rd item in the Apple-TAB list, and the incorrect menu bar is always one of the applications to the left of X11 in the Apple-TAB list. It also only seems to happen when switching to X11 involves switching spaces.

I am running XQuartz 2.7.7 on Yosemite.

I am running on a 2012 non-retina MBP with an external display, which I use as my primary display. I am not running in mirror mode.
