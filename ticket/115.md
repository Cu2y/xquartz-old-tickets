xauth fails when accessing auth file on afp mounted filesystems
===============================================================


Symptom:
When the X11 server is started or the user attempts to use the 'xauth' command, the lockfile .Xauthority-c is created in the user's home directory on an afp mounted filesystem.
The existence of this file prevents the xauth command from running either locally or on a remote system which shares the filesystem, thus preventing remote access to the Xserver.

Workaround: the user should remove ~/.Xauthority-c after starting the X11 server.

Diagnosis: The locking mechanism in the library function XauLockAuth (xc/lib/Xau/AuLock.c) uses the link()
system call. link() is unsupported on afp filesystems.
I'd suggest modifying the locking mechanism such that it does not rely on link(), and/or ensure that in the event of failure, that the function removes any lock files it has created.

We have the very same problem. We've had some success by trying to specify a path for `.Xauthority` with the `XAUTHORITY` environment variable so that it is created on a local disk, but with very limited results.

Your diagnosis and proposed solution sounds much better.
