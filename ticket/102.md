switching X11 windows across spaces leaves Spaces confused
==========================================================


(This example assumes the standard 2x2 spaces layout)

Create some X11 windows in spaces 1 and 3. While in space 1, select one of the space-3 windows from X11's Windows menu
(or use the command-N keyboard shortcut for it). The display switches to space 3, and anything else that was in space 3
shows up, but it seems that some part of Spaces still thinks that space 1 is active: control-uparrow does nothing, and control-downarrow does a "scroll" that redisplays space 3.

I also notice that a space-switch done this way is "instant" instead of using the scroll effect ... is that intended?

This might be related to
<http://lists.apple.com/archives/X11-users/2008/May/msg00059.html>
though for me the behavior is the same in either direction, ie space 1 isn't special.

2.2.1, not 2.2.0

Info from dp:

    I've re-run this test a bit more scientifically. I now have 4 spaces with applications in each space. X11 apps are in Space #⁠4. This is what I experience and it is completely reproducible:

    1) From any of space 1, 2, or 3 I right click on the X11 icon on the dock and select an Xterm from the list. (There are 5 to choose from and it does not matter which I choose, the results are the same.)

    2) My space lurches from where it is to space #⁠4. The selected Xterm may or may not be on top of the Z axis, but it is active.

    3) I move the mouse to the Dock and select a running app that is in the same space I was before the lurch. The tool bar at the top of the screen indicates the application is active but Space #⁠4 remains the current view. This is also the case if I try to use ctrl and the previous space #.

    4) I try the available options to return to the previous space: Ctrl + number, and the Spaces menu in the tool bar at the top of the screen. Neither work.

    5) I try going to one of the other two spaces with ctrl + number. That is successful, and from there I can now vault to any space with any of the vaulting options.

    6) Here it gets interesting. I am in Space #⁠1 and right click the X11 dock icon and select an Xterm as before. Now I know that space #⁠1 is just one ctrl + -> (right arrow) from space #⁠4 so I try that and *LURCH*! I find myself in space #⁠2, not #⁠1.

    This is consistent with any beginning place. So long as the attempt is to return to the previous space it ain't gonna happen.

    Except: My F8 key is set to Expose` the spaces panels on the screen. From this screen I can return to space #⁠1.
