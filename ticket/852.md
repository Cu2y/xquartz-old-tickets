x11 cannot be found
===================


I upgraded to Mavericks from Mountain Lion and was instructed to update to 2.7.5 to run Wordsearch9. I have downloaded it twice and it does open however when I try to launch Wordsearch9 I get an error message: X11 cannot be found.

Please contact Wordsearch9 developers. They're doing something wrong.
