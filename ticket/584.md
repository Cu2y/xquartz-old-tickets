XQuartz 2.7.2
=============


XQuartz 2.7.2 always crashes in OS 10.6.7 on two different Macs of mine.

Trying to use it for Gimp but it will not launch. Crashes within seconds.

Is there a workaround?

Thanks -- Jack

The crash report shows that you haven't even hit main() yet... that's crashing during loading... /shrug... I'll try tomorrow on my SL machine, but if this were a "real" problem, I'd suspect a lot more noise than one user =/

Try nuking it and reinstalling.

Please ask on x11-users for help.

Please do the following (from Terminal.app) and report what is printed:

    $ set | grep DYLD
    $ DYLD_PRINT_INITIALIZERS=1 DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

I am sorry that you found my report so personally offensive. It was not intended to be personally critical of you but I am totally out of other resources and have had two people suggest that I submit a bug report to you.

I have nuked and re-installed both XQuartz and Gimp 3 different time on each of 2 totally different Macs. Identical result in all 6 trials. XQuartz crashes upon loading on my machines.

I have attached the result of the Terminal query you requested and am hoping that if it is not an application bug maybe you can give me an idea of what is wrong. I have spent over 8 hours talking with other users prior to submitting the report which you dismissed as nonsense and have no other place to turn.

I'm really anxious to use Gimp and am hoping you can help.

Very sorry for whatever I said that you found so offensive.

Thank you for any help you might choose to offer.

Sincerely -- Jack Stewart

Huh? What makes you think that I took this offensively?

I'm unable to reproduce this with XQuartz 2.7.2 on my SL 10.6.8 machine. I'm suggesting you take this to the x11-users mailing list because there is nothing here for me to really go on, and that will get you many more eyes to offer suggestions.

You have not provided the other bit of information. Please tell me if there is any output from:

set | grep DYLD

Yes I did provide the out put from output from: set | grep DYLD. I ttached it last night in my reply to you and it is still there.

No, therte is no out form whatever.

I'm not going to belabor the point of how you took the report other than to say: Sorry if I was wrong but your response seemed to indicate that I was a real dunce for submitting the report in the first place and that you were too busy to be bothered with me.

I would sure appreciate any insight you can provide from the attached output from: set | grep DYLD. It is named: "Terminal Query for XQuartz bug report".

Thank you,

Jack

The attachment just shows your DYLD\_PRINT\_INITIALIZERS=1 DYLD\_PRINT\_LIBRARIES=1 output.

Are you telling me that there are no DYLD\_ environment variable set? That's what I'm trying to get at...

Now, I don't think this is a "real" issue. It sounds more like a configuration issue to me. If it were a real, catastrophic bug, there would be people yelling and screaming on the mailing list. This seems like an isolated incident, and I really have no clue what to have you try beyond the basic steps. If this doesn't reveal the solution, please bring it up on the mailing list. I will be gone for a month, and if you just respond here, you probably won't get a response until July.

Make sure you've tried:

1) Create a new user account
2) Test X11.app as well
