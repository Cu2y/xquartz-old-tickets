Gamma Control (Support RandR 1.2)
=================================


Just a feature request...

It would be great, now especially with RandR being put in, if Xquartz could control the screens gamma. Some games in X (native or Wine) are kind of dark and have gamma sliders in them, but in Xquartz they don't do anything... because from what I can tell Xquartz has no way to control screen gamma.

This could look weird in rootless mode, so maybe make it optional for rootless, but works in fullscreen modes?

What are those games calling into to set the gamma? Is it via RandR or some other mechanism?

I really wish I knew... how would I find out? I know that the x server in Crossover handles it fine, but they might have work-a-rounds in their Wine source too.. but their Winesource by itself doesn't fix it cuz I've already built that against Xquartz and it was a no go.

I'll see what I can find out.

according to Vitamin on the winehq forums...
gamma is controlled with Wine using... VidMode X11 extension (XF86VidModeSetGamma, XF86VidModeSetGammaRamp functions).

Yeah, I don't think we'll be supporting xf86vm ... why don't they use RandR 1.3 to adjust gamma instead?

probably no one has gotten around to it.... its no major deal, just a "would be nice" type of thing... I'm sure eventually they will, so it might be best to add support in Xquartz for RandR gamma, as its more of the future.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Summary** changed from *Gamma Control* to *Gamma Control (Support RandR 1.2)*
-   **Milestone** changed from *later* to *2.8.0*

It would be nice to do this soon. We should implement RandR 1.2:

    #if RANDR_12_INTERFACE
        RRScreenSetSizeProcPtr rrScreenSetSize;
        RRCrtcSetProcPtr rrCrtcSet;
        RRCrtcSetGammaProcPtr rrCrtcSetGamma;
        RRCrtcGetGammaProcPtr rrCrtcGetGamma;
        RROutputSetPropertyProcPtr rrOutputSetProperty;
        RROutputValidateModeProcPtr rrOutputValidateMode;
        RRModeDestroyProcPtr rrModeDestroy;
    #endif

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
