Window open in one desktop cannot be moved to another desktops on Mavericks OSX 10.9
====================================================================================


After I updated to OSX 10.9 Mavericks, whenever I open a new window in any desktop, I cannot move it to another desktop. It seems to disappear under the adjacent screen. Almost like each screen is its own computer.
