Text bigger after 2.3.2 rc1
===========================


This is using the PyGTK application WingIDE. After installing 2.3.2 rc1, text is drawn bigger than with previous versions, keeping the same font sizes. This is after moving away my ~/.fonts.conf

changing the following line in /usr/X11/bin/startx,

defaultserverargs="-dpi 72"

brings back the same text size as 2.3.1.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Version** set to *dev (xorg-server-1.4-apple)*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

The changed behavior is expected.
