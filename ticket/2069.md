Unable to install 2.7.7
=======================


On Mac Mavericks; get to the login with Administrator id/password prompt and nothing works.

Other Mac apps auto-populate the current user name but this package does not. Tried both my name and my id and neither worked. I've installed lots of apps with this account information and retried multiple times so believe this may be an issue with the installer.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

This is not an XQuartz bug. Either user error or a system bug.
