I fixed Xosdefs.h.

Ben, where are those /xorg/\* files coming from? It looks like an antiquated xorg-server/include directory.

weird... according to the Makefile.am in the include directory, those should only install if the XORG DDX is enabled. I'm guessing this was some kind of hackery or bug in the build system that has since been fixed, so it looks all clean now (except that user will have leftover cruft on their systems until 10.6 I suppose)...
