Windows refuse to accept input
==============================


Intel Mac running 10.5.5:

Every so often (once or twice a day) my X11 windows will all refuse input.

ie if I mouse over the window that had focus when this happens, it gets focus (I can see the cursor in my terminal change), however I cannot scroll or select, or enter. No other X11 window will gain focus.

X11 windows cannot be re-sized or minimized etc. I can switch to the Xquartz app and the menu's work, allowing me to minimize windows that way. So Xquartz is somewhat responsive.

This is (as you can imagine) very frustrating and requires a force-quit and the loss of any unsaved work. I have tried the fixs
for the old scrolling freeze (to which this appears very similar), which involved runing killall -STOP X11 ; killall -CONT X11, however this has no effect.

whoa! I just got it to unstick! I minimized several windows using the Xquartz menu, and then all the input I had tried and presumably was buffered up went through!

At least I may have a work around.

Also, I forgot to mention, my syslog has many of these entries:
Sep 26 13:25:16 nick-blievers-computer org.x.startx\[298\]: DarwinPressModifierKey bad keycode: key=5
Sep 26 13:25:17 nick-blievers-computer org.x.startx\[298\]: DarwinPressModifierKey bad keycode: key=7

Sep 26 13:26:35 nick-blievers-computer org.x.startx\[298\]: DarwinPressModifierKey bad keycode: key=5

Although the times do not coincide with the freeze, so they may be irrelevant.

Hit this again. Would just like to confirm that if you minimize the window that was active when the freeze occurs, everything will go back to normal.

Are you experiencing this with 2.3.2.1 ? The input code changed significantly between 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

If you're still experiencing this issue, could you tell me what 'xinput test &lt;the id of your pointer&gt;' outputs while you are trying to interact?

I am pretty sure I have hit it with 2.3.2. Haven't been using my Mac system a lot lately -- however, I will upgrade to 2.3.2.1 and see if I can reproduce and provide the output you request.

Hmm, sorry for the double post, but given the date that 2.3.2 was released and the amount (very little) of time spent on my Mac since that date, I doubt I have hit it in 2.3.2 (I just didn't remember upgrading).

I can confirm that this issue occurs on 2.3.2.1 on a ppc g4 powerbook running 10.5.6. Minimizing the window from the menu bar restores control.

Is this still happening with 2.4.0\_rc1?

I have what I believe is exactly the same problem. I had it with the default Snow Leopard X11 install, when I upgraded to XQuartz 2.4.1, and still with the most recent XQuartz 2.5.0. The minimize trick noted above does work for me. Notably, the freeze occurs consistently when I use the Command-backtick shortcut to change active windows, but only if I have "Enable key equivalents under X11" unchecked in Preferences.

I'm currently running OS X 10.6.2 on an 8-core Mac Pro.

Strangely, the same versions of both OS X and XQuartz on my MacBook do not show this problem.

If I start 'xinput test pointer' or 'xinput test keyboard' in an xterm prior to causing the freeze, it continues to properly register keystrokes and pointer movements and clicks, even though none of them are getting through to the active window. When I use the minimize trick to unfreeze, the keystrokes I had entered are suddenly sent through to the active window, so they must have been stuck in a buffer somewhere.

This is fixed in the recent 2.5.0 betas.

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/169#comment:16):

> This is fixed in the recent 2.5.0 betas.

This problem is not fixed for me with XQuartz 2.5.0\_beta2 (xorg-server 1.7.4.901). Exact same symptoms as before. Minimize trick unsticks the frozen windows.
