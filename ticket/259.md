libGL.1.2.dylib shipped with 2.3.3 RC5 makes applications crash
===============================================================


Hello. I am unsure whether to raise a ticket or email xquartz-dev, as I don't know that the one I am reporting is a bug. Please bear with me.

Is X11-2.3.3 supposed to be backward compatible? I have installed it, and found that a number of applications which use /usr/X11/lib/libGL.1.dylib crash. I have also verified that replacing libGL.1.2.dylib with the corresponding file from X11-2.3.2.1, the applications seem to run well again (incidentally, I found strange that the two version of the library are very different in size: 2.3M for 2.3.2.1, against 798K for 2.3.3).

Is this expected? I wouldn't think so, or there would at least have been a bump version number of GL. So, is it a bug to be fixed in X11-2.3.3?

I attach below the output of GDB in the case of one crash (of the open-source application mplayer). I don't think it is particularly useful, it doesn't am happy to help debug, but I need to be instructed about what information/tests you may need.

Question: is it safe to downgrade to 2.3.2.1 by simply installing X11-2.3.2.1 on top of 2.3.3.RC5, or should I remove /usr/X11 entirely before reinstalling? Thx

Please bring this up on xquartz-dev for faster iteration and more eyes. This bug report is vague and I can't really do anything about it without specifics.

Please give me examples of applications that fail with the new libGL.

mplayer is not a good example as it's not using GLX. It's using OpenGL.framework directly.
