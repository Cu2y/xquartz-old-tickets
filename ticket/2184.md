"h" key still repeats in XQuartz 2.7.8
======================================


HI Folks,

> While I was delighted to see a new version in XQuartz, the first thing I checked was whether the repeating "h" key issue (after Hiding XQuarts using CMD-H in OS X) was fixed only to find that it it still has not been.

Can someone explain why this was overlooked? I believe its been complained about for many years now.

thanks,
/d

-   **Resolution** set to *Duplicate*

As you mentioned, there's already a bug tracking this.

It hasn't been overlooked. There are just no resources available to fix such bugs. If you can provide a fix, I'll gladly get it into a release.
