copy/paste issue on terminal
============================


Hello,

I have Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and XQuartz 2.7.4 running on my Intel MaC Book. Some times, I don't have a mouse available to me. In this case, I don't know how to use keyboard and trackpad to make copy and paste on the X11 terminal running on XQuartz. Copy seems simply, commnad-c should do the job and it is also available from the Edit menu. But the problem is how I can paste it. If I use command-v, I will get a funny symbol. I don't such a problem with a mouse plugged in. What I am asking is how to do copy/paste on the same terminal without a mouse.

Thanks for help!

This is an issue with individual X11 clients and not X11 itself. The data is present in X11's PRIMARY buffer, and it's up to the client (application) to do with it what it will. This is why the server (XQuartz.app) has no notion of paste.

Thanks a lot for reply. If I understood correctly, what you were saying is I can't copy/paster on X11 terminal using only keyboard and/or trackpad (no mouse). Is that correct?
Frankly, I don't understand when you said "up to the client (application) to do with it what it will". For example, if I use X11 terminal from XQuartz.app to connect a remote cluster,
how can I copy/paster on terminal without using a mouse? That's my simple question.

Thanks again!

Pasting into xterm requires you to press the middle mouse button. If you don't have a middle mouse, you can enable emulation in preferences.

At this level of abstraction, a trackpad is essentially a mouse, so you \*have\* a mouse (it's a trackpad).

Thanks! Now I got it. I searched the net and installed MiddleClick to make trackpad emulating 3-butoon mouse. After that, 3-finger tapping on trackpad corresponds to middle button of a mouse. MiddleClick does the magic.

There's a good solution here: <http://superuser.com/a/558944/36702>
