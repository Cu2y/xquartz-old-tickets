Hide the XQuartz dock icon and add one for each X client.
=========================================================


Getting rid of XQuartz as a top-level OS X application (or at least, giving the appearance of getting rid of it) and instead adding (possibly dummy) OS X application entries to the Dock and Cmd-Tab task switcher which activate XQuartz.app and in it the appropriate X client would go a long way of providing a more integrated feel between X clients and native OS X applications.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.0 (xserver-1.2)*
-   **Milestone** set to *later*

This is something that has been a rather pipe-dream request which may be mildly possible eventually, but it is not really worth the development effort.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *wontfix*

yeah, I don't see this as worth the engineering effort.

Implementing this would be a great improvement in accessibility, especially for most people which are not "geeks". Try to think about the "others", which are not coders.

I'm not saying it would be a bad idea. I think it would be great. The problem is that it is not an easy problem to solve.
