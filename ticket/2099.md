Quartz 2.7.7 "Extract update..." hangs on Yosemite 10.10.1
==========================================================


Hi,

I've a brand new iMac, running Yosemite 10.10.1.

I successfully installed xquartz 2.7.6, but when attempting to upgrade to 2.7.7 it hangs on "Extracting update..."

I've attached results of "sysdiagnose" which I ran during the hang. I'm also attaching system.log

I can "force quit" the extraction, can quit xquartz, restart, and the hang is reproducible if restart xquartz and check for update.
Best,

Robert

Yeah, this is a known issue in Sparkle. Please install the update manually. It should be fixed in 2.7.8 (when updating FROM 2.7.8)
