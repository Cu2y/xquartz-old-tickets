xauth doesn't recognize local Apple $DISPLAY names
==================================================


The xauth program has code in both gethost.c and parsedpy.c to look for $DISPLAY names that start with "/tmp/launch", and to treat that as a local socket. However, the location seems to have changed, $DISPLAY now starts with "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd", so the code that is looking for /tmp/launch doesn't catch it. Instead, xauth tries to resolve the path as a DNS name, which fails after a timeout delay, I'm typically seeing 5-8 seconds of delay.

I first noticed the delays after upgrading to Yosemite.
