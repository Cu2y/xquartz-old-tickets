Can't change language
=====================


XQuartz (or X11) won't allow me to change languages on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.1). if I set OS X to support both English and Russian text inputs, and I run XQuartz when English is selected, I won't be able to write in Russian in any XQuartz app but I can do it in other apps. If I run XQuartz when Russian is selected, I won't be able to write in English.
