2.7.0 beta2 installer does not set XQuartz as default x server
==============================================================


After installing 2.7.0 beta2, XQuartz is no longer the default x server. Instead the native x11 become the default.

I have restarted my computer after the installation. I have tried both the automatic update and a downloaded \*.dmg.

The 2.7.0 beta1 installer works as expected, and reinstalling beta1 restores XQuartz as the default x server.

OS X 10.6.8

Same here: 2.7.0\_beta2 is installed, but isn't used by X applications.

-   If I have neither system X11 nor XQuartz running, and I launch a X app from the Terminal, system X11 will open.
-   If I have XQuartz running, and I launch an X app from the Terminal, it will launch X11 and run there; XQuartz stays open, but isn't used.
-   If both XQuartz and X11 are up, and I launch an X app from the Terminal, it will open in system X11.

Yeah, there was a permissions problem. Do:

sudo chmod 644 /Library/Launch\*/\*xquartz\*

Then reboot.

I have no idea why this happened. I did nothing different with beta3, and the permissions are correct there... =/

Please verify that 2.7.0\_beta3 installs correctly.

2.7.0\_beta3 installs with the correct permissions.

2.7.0\_beta3 installs for me correctly as well.
