Menu Bar sometimes doesn't change to X11
========================================


I've noticed that sometimes when switching spaces, XQuartz won't display its menu bar even though it has focus. I can click on XQuartz windows and the clicks interact with the windows. Key presses go the windows. Even keyboard short-cuts work. However, the menu bar still shows the options for another application (usually Finder). In order to get the right menu bar, I have to switch to another application and back to XQuartz. Clicking on the menu bar and then a XQuartz window also works.

The sequence of steps that reliably reproduces the problem on my two machines is:
1) In a space with X11 windows, click on the background so that Finder has focus.
2) Switch to a different space using Control-LeftArrow.
3) Then, click on the XQuartz dock icon.
4) At this point, the bug is evident. The menu bar says the focus is on Finder, but clicking on X11 windows doesn't assign focus to XQuartz. It already has focus.

This has been true for every version of XQuartz I've run on Mavericks. It didn't happen before then.

Thanks!

I've seen this behavior as well, although I'm not exactly sure when it started.

I'm running XQuartz 2.7.7 on MacOS 10.9.5.

For me, this behavior occurs whenever switching to the XQuartz application involves changing spaces, regardless of how I make XQuartz active -- cmd-tab is usual for me. Almost all of the time, the menu that appears is that of the previously-active application, but there are rare exceptions to this.

If it matters, I have the following options selected in the Mission Control prefs pane:

-   When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for that application
-   Group windows by application
-   Displays have separate Spaces

I have *not* selected "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use."

XQuartz windows are assigned to space 1.

My home machine (on which I write this) has a single display, so the "Displays have separate Spaces" option isn't really relevant. However, my work machine does have 2 displays, and I have this option *deselected* on that machine. I don't have access to that machine at the moment, but I'm pretty sure I see this behavior there as well.

I don't really think this is something that we have control over. Was it resolved by more recent OS versions?

I still experience it consistently in MacOS 10.10.5 with XQuartz 2.7.7 and have experienced it consistently on all of the OS versions since 10.9.5. I have not yet upgraded any of my systems to 10.11. (I'm waiting for 10.11.1, mostly on general principles.)

I don't know enough about MacOS application development to have a clear understanding of the division of responsibilities involved when the user switches between different applications. However, since I experience this only when switching to XQuartz from some other application, that does suggest pretty strongly to me that the error lies somewhere in the interaction between XQuartz and the OS/desktop environment. (Forgive my imprecise terminology; I don't know the standard names for the various MacOS components.) If the XQuartz developers believe that they're following all of the necessary interface contracts, would it be possible to submit a bug against MacOS itself?

I also just noticed that if the "About X11" dialog is visible and has focus, then if I cmd-tab to another application on a different space and cmd-tab back to XQuartz, I *do* get the X11 menu bar -- but the "About X11" dialog still has focus, and I have to click on one of the actual client windows before I can actually interact with any client, so that's not really a feasible solution.

(XQuartz 2.7.7, MacOS 10.10.5.)

Certainly, I agree. There is something "odd" about that boundary that isn't working quite right, and there are other impacts as well (eg: [\#⁠58](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/58)).
