TTF fonts render poorly in server 2.5.2
=======================================


I installed 2.5.2 on my final-generation PPC G5 imac. The fonts displayed in a distorted manner with off-register color and pixels not being drawn. I have attached two PNG files of one application (XEmacs) displaying the same buffer and using the same font (Charis SIL Compact). In xterms, I use Bitstream Vera Sans. However, in 2.5.2 the font that an xterm displays "looks" different from Bitstream Vera Sans when compared to a non-X application (and compared to a 2.5.1 xterm).

Here is the command that X uses to start on both servers:
/usr/X11/bin/xinit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- /usr/X11/bin/X :0 -dpi 102 -auth /Users/royar/.serverauth.18641
\[of course the serverauth filename changes\].

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.0*

The new version of freetype uses the bytecode interpreter instead of the unpatented hinting ... you might want to bring this up with the freetype developers

I had the opportunity to experiment today, and I discovered that I can get acceptable font drawing by removing my ~/.fonts.conf file. I still cannot get a readable Charis SIL font. For some reason it will not render any better. I also tried compiling the new freetype (2.4.1) without TT\_CONFIG\_OPTION\_BYTECODE\_INTERPRETER defined and with TT\_CONFIG\_OPTION\_UNPATENTED\_HINTING defined (the previous default). That gave me the best overall satisfaction (in that all the fonts reproduced well). But that is not a solution since TT\_CONFIG\_OPTION\_UNPATENTED\_HINTING is a deprecated define and will eventually disappear.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

I'm closing this as "3rd party to resolve" … we're essentially "stuck" on this codepath, but I urge you to file a ticket with freetype to address your concerns with this font.
