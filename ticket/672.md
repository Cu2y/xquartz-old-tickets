Uncontrolled "h" key repeats
============================


Dear all,

This time I've nailed it! For many years I've been using XQuartz and form time to time, I've experience the uncontrolled fast repeat of one key I am typing. Today, I've noticed one particular pattern and I've been able to reproduce the problem 100% of times. AT LAST !!!!!!

This problem has always happened, since Tiger at least (before Tiger, I can't remember). I'm using 10.6.8 (of course!).

Here it is (some steps may in the end not be essential, but at least, that procedure works perfectly):

> A/ Open several applications on your Mac in addition to XQuartz. For instance Safari, iTunes, ...

> B/ Have several Xterm windows opened

> C/ Bring the focus to one Xterm window

> D/ Hit the Command-H keys. That makes the whole XQuartz application disappear.

---

> E/ Hit Command-Tab and maintain the Command key down

> F/ Hit the ~ key to traverse backwards the list of opened apps up to XQuartz

> G/ Release all keys.

---

> H/ Click on the top of the frame to bring the focus back to that same Xterm window. DO NOT CLICK inside the Xterm ! Only on the MacOS frame of the window.

---

> I/ Hit the "h" key (only the letter "h") JUST ONCE.

> J/ Enjoy the show ! The "l" key gets repeated as if you were leaving your finger on the key, wherever the prompt is.

> J.1/ Have fun --&gt; hold the control key down ! The "h" letters start being erased one at a time. Release the Control key .. "h" line grows.

> J.2/ You can stop this frantic autorepeat with the Esc key.

I've reproduced this successfully 100% of the time.

Is that an Easter Egg or some sort of funny hidden game ?

I hope you can.
Best regards,
Thierry

Me again ....

I've tried with just switching apps using Command-Tab.

Back to XQuartz, the XTerm has the focus.

If you hit "h" at that moment, wherever the prompt is, the "h" key repeats itself as if the key was held down. Only happens with the "h" key so far. I've not tried all keys of the keyboard but a few others. Only "h" does that.

And while the "h" characters franticly repeats itself, holding the Control key down ... gets the "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" line to be erased form the right as if the "delete" key was held down. Releasing the Control key gets it to run again like crazy. Esc stops that Sorcerer's Apprentice.

Not funny when you're editing valuable code and hit Command-h instead of Control-h on nedit !!!

Best regards,
Thierry

Bummer !!! Without to know, I used formatting characters. Some parts of my original text have disappeared .

Please consider the following as my first post.
