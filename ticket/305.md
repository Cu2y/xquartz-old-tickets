Stuck keys in X11 when using Expose/Spaces
==========================================


When using expose/spaces with X11, if a key is being held down when the expose/spaces is activated, X11 acts as if that key is being held down until the keyboard is used again.

Steps to replicate:

Start X11
Open an xterm
Hold down any key in that Xterm
While holding down that key, activate Expose (e.g. press F9)
Take finger off key being held down, notice that the characters continue to appear in the xterm window.

Note:

Pressing F9 again does not stop this. Also if using spaces, the key presses will transfer to the active X11 window on the new space (suggesting this is not a bug in xterm, but rather the way X11 traps keyboard input).

Note also filed as Radar <a href="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/305" class="missing ticket">#⁠7190678</a> as this affects SL's X11 also.

-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.1*

I'm not sure if this is even something that we can fix in X11. We may need some new notification from Dock.app...

Hi,
I am still using 10.5.8 on a 2006 iMac C2D 24".
I have been using the latest Leopard XQuartz dmg for a couple years; now I use 2.5.3.
I have had a stuck 'H'/'h' key for almost all this time, what I can remember, and still right now.
I never use Fink/Macports to build most apps (they all kill my env-vars I want/need to use).
Instead I will painstakingly build all sorts of open-src apps by hand (and I do mean a huge amount, mainly: most all libs for ffmpeg/mplayer support, the GTK/glib stuff for Pan newsreader and the HDHomeRun SiliconDust apps, etc).
I also never have any use for Expose/Spaces, so I can say this bug is for 'plain' use.
I don't think any other key gets 'stuck' like the H/h does here on most any XQuartz app.
N.B. I do not see any such stuck keys on (regular) OSX apps.
FWIW I am still worried so much about building FOSS for SL that I am staying with 10.5.x probably 'til the cows come home (sorry).
(I cannot see the rdar article here either.)
Please advise?
Thank you.

This bug is \*specifically\* about an understood problem with stuck keys when using spaces and exposé. This \*only\* happens with Spaces and Exposé. If you are experiencing a stuck "h" under normal use, then you are likely experiencing a different problem. Please join the mailing list for help, but I suggest you start by ensuring you don't have a ~/.Xresources nor ~/.Xmodmap file

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
