Can't install XQuartz because digitial signature is invalid
===========================================================


Hello,

I'm trying to install XQuartz 2.7.6 (<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.6.dmg>) on MacBook Pro with Mavericks 10.9.4. When I click on the XQuartz.pkg, I get the following error:

"XQuartz.pkg can't be installed because its digital signature is invalid.
The package may have been corrupted or tampered with. Get a new copy of the package and try again."

I've tried 2.7.7\_beta1 and I get the same error. I have my Security settings set to "Anywhere".

What am I doing wrong? I cannot find anybody on the Internet with the same problem. Thank you,

Paul

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Cannot Reproduce*

The signature seems fine to me. Please ask for help on the x11-users mailing list.
