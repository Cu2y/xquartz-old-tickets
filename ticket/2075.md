Running Wireshark
=================


I get this error in Console...
Dyld Error Message:

> Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libcairo.2.dylib
> Referenced from: /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/bin/wireshark-bin
> Reason: image not found

I suspect quartz perhaps does not load this file that Wireshark (1.12.2) is expecting? All apps in this case are up to date. Only thing that may muddy the water is the OS which is 10.10.1

Quartz is .... XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2)

What I did to fix was delete the Quartz X11 app, downloaded the installer again and re installed. This time the /usr/x11/lib has many .lib files and my wireshark runs clean.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Yes, the OS installer deleted the /usr/X11 symlink. Reinstalling XQuartz fixes the issue.
