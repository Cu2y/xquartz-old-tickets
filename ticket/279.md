XQuartz 2.3.3.2 enabled Wacom support in Gimp, but broke mouse support
======================================================================


So I finally installed 2.3.3.2 and, after some poking about in Gimp's preferences, found a way to enable Wacom tablet support with pressure sensitivity and everything.

Which is quite awesome.

Except the mouse stopped working.

Or, rather, clicking on the canvas with any tool selected doesn't do anything. And in the lower left corner of the canvas window the mouse cursor's current position on the canvas is shown as negative 1.3 million or something like that.

Gimp is version 2.6.1, by the way.

I have no idea why it's broken, but having to do everything on the tablet with Gimp is annoying the hell out of me.

What is the output of 'xinput test pointer' as you are doing this? If it's showing sane values, then it's most likely a problem with gimp.

gimp 2.4.7 and gimp 2.6.6 work fine according to users on the xquartz-dev mailing list. Try updating your version of gimp.

Upgrading to 2.6.6 did not help.

'xinput test pointer' only shows values (and sane ones at that) when the pointer is outside Gimp's canvas window.

And your bug reporting system does not work. I can't reopen this bug.

well, you don't have permission to reopen this bug.

this is a bug in gimp. Others are using it perfectly fine. I suggest you join the xquartz-dev mailing list and mention this there since 3 others reported everything was ok.
