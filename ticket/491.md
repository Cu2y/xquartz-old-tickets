A legacy Java3D app crashes X11.bin in 2.6.3\_rc1
=================================================


I've been playing with 2.6.3\_rc1 on and off as time permits and have found something that reliably crashes X11.bin.

The test.java is some simple code I use to make sure new versions of Xquartz haven't broken use of some of our legacy apps that utilize Java3D. Our use case is the running of this test.java code on Solaris 10 displaying back to Mac OS X.

Here is the thread in X11.bin that crashed:

    Thread 2 Crashed:
    0   X11.bin                         0x0000000100118293 __glXAquaScreenCreateContext + 684

I'll attach the test.java code as well as the crash log.

The small Java3D application that seems to be able reliably trigger the crash

One thing I forgot to mention. The test.java app does NOT crash 2.6.2. So this is definitely something new with 2.6.3\_rc1.
