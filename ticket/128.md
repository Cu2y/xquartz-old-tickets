xterm has lost 2 of its 3 menus (2.3.0-rc4)
===========================================


In 2.3.0-rc4, the two drop-down menus in xterm that should appear with

-   ctl-alt-click (this is ctl-button2 with a 1-button mouse) "VT-OPTIONS"
    and
-   ctl-cmd-click (this is ctl-button3) "VT-FONTS"

do not show up. Only the menu "MAIN OPTIONS" obtained by ctl-click remains.

All 3 menus are still present in xquartz-2.2.1.

Uh... xterm has not changed at all between 2.2.1 and 2.3.0-rc4. It's the exact same version. In fact. I just tried this, and it works fine.
