DISPLAY gets changed incorrectly by X11 libs
============================================


A Perl Tk script that worked fine with 2.5.0 (and many previous versions) fails with 2.5.1 beta2, reporting:

    _X11TransSocketINETConnect() can't get address for org.macosforge.xquartz:6000: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

    couldn't connect to display "org.macosforge.xquartz:0.0" at /Library/Perl/5.10.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level/Tk/MainWindow.pm line 55.

    MainWindow->new() at /Users/tgl/lib/listener_frontend.pl line 64

(I hadn't tried beta1 so I'm not sure whether the behavior was different in it.)

Unfortunately this script is part of my daily workflow so it's kind of critical for me :-(

If you have Perl Tk installed then a sufficient reproducer is

perl -e 'use Tk; MainWindow-&gt;new'

Further experimentation shows that ssh X11 forwarding is also broken: on the remote machine I get

org.macosforge.xquartz: unknown host. (nodename nor servname provided, or not known)
X connection to localhost:10.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

Going to have to revert to 2.5.0, since this means that nothing that I want to do with X11 works :-(

On further review, this seems to be caused by the mistaken setting of $DISPLAY that is currently being discussed on xquartz-dev.

This will be fixed in 2.5.1\_beta3 or 2.5.1\_rc1
