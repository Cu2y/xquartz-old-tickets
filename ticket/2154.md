All X11 applications hangs up after syscall "recvfrom"
======================================================


I asked a question a few days ago, still got no answers.
So I decided to report this as a bug here.

Refer to:
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31904915/all-x11-applications-got-unavailable-in-mac-osx-yosemite>
<https://discussionsjapan.apple.com/message/100904332#100904332>

Sorry for crossposting. If I get a solution, I'll immediately update them.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

See the reply in SO. I suggest you use the x11-users mailing list (at top right) for future questions like this.

The following variable setting lead to work...

DISPLAY=:0.0

That was very simple reason, sorry
