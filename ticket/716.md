gedit crashes with "glib detected" and "malloc: memory corruption".
===================================================================


On my local mac OSX 10.8.2 I am starting XQuartz and either Terminal or xterm.
When I connect to a remote Linux computer using ssh -X ...
and run gedit, it crashes with the message displayed in the terminal window:

> **\* glibc detected** \* /usr/bin/gedit: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000006fcea0 **\*
> **

This does not happen with kate editor. Also there are no errors when
I connect from my Windows PC with putty and Xming (X11) to the same remote Linux machine
and run gedit -- because of this I cannot say that the issue is not in XQuartz.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

gedit and kate are completely different applications. You should report errors pertaining to gedit to the gedit developers.
