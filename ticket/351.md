'X11.app' won't start when home folder is located at something like '/Volumes/Michael's Home/Users/Michael'
===========================================================================================================


I've posted my question on <http://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2010/Feb/index.html>.
I can't open X11 when home folder is located at '/Volumes/Michael's Home/Users/Michael'.
The problem seems to be my use of single quote "'" and spaces " " in my pathname, especially on my home directory.

My problem has been solved by:
(1) rename my HD to 'Michaels\_Home' under 'Get Info' from Finder (I can't rename in Disk Utility though)
(2) press return (enter)
(3) change my home folder path to the '/Volumes/Michaels\_Home/Users/Michael' (<http://eshop.macsales.com/Reviews/Framework.cfm?page=Tips/relocate3/relocate3.html>)
(4) restart
(5) log in and open X11
(6) problem solved

Hope X11 will support the directory like something as 'Volumes/Michael's Home/Users/Michael/' in the future.

PS: I have a MacBook White (13-inch, Mid 2009) that isn't unibody, and was running Leopard 10.5.
I did a clean installation of 10.6.2 Snow Leopard from the USD$29 disc.
