Application menu in OS X menu bar.
==================================


Putting the application menu in the OS X menu bar instead of a rather pointless X11 menu would go a long way to giving a better feel of integration between X11 clients and native OS X applications.

This likely requires the corporation of XQuartz and quartz-wm.
