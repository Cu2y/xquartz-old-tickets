XQuartz Yosemite new terminal window doesn't start
==================================================


Since upgrading to Mac OSX Yosemite, XQuartz doesn't open a new terminal window automatically, i.e. on starting XQuartz in OSX 10.8, I used to get a terminal window immediately, now not. I'm running XQuartz 2.7.7, but 2.7.4 also produces this problem.

For example, if I am in the standard terminal application and run "xterm", I get the error "Can't open display", but if I start XQuartz first, then I get an xterm window starting OK.

Am I missing something in a setting or preference?

Please provide the full error message you get from xterm.

The full message is

xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.O1ZkZtyTzg/org.macosforge.xquartz:0

This is the default without setting the DISPLAY environment variable set. I can set it e.g.
export DISPLAY=:0.0

but then it just says

xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: :0.0

Further note: command xinit starts X11 AND an xterm screen at the same time - is this something to do with the Xserver not starting properly?

I expect you to have that error with 2.7.4, but you should not with 2.7.7. Is that really what you see with 2.7.7? What is the output of 'which xterm'? What is the output of 'echo $DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH'?

OK all working now with 2.7.7 - sorry about that!!
