Color of lower right hand expander is not set properly
======================================================


I just installed gimp 2.8 <http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html> with XQuartz-2.7.2

I noticed the lower right hand expander icon has the white background while gimp has a dark grey background. This icon should be transparent so it can displayed properly.

There's no way to really fix that. It's an OS X resource.
