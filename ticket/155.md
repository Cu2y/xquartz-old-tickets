using Wacom Graphire3 Mouse as input device slows down Qemu
===========================================================


I was using my Wacom Graphire3 drawing tablet's mouse as my mouse under Qemu 0.8.1: I noticed that the driver was using such an exorbitantly high amount of system resources that it slowed Qemu down to a crawl. At the time I was running 10.4.7 using Apple's XFree86 version 4.5.X. This slowdown may affect Leopard's X.org branch of X11 too: I've been too concerned with Project Q 0.9.0's emulation speed to dare try hooking up the Wacom Graphire3 Tablet again.

If I have a chance to compile a stable SDL linked version of Qemu 0.9.1 I will test it using QemuX (I'm probably one of the few Mac users out there who still actually keeps it in his archive). This bug report is marked for version 2.3.0 of the Mac OS X X.org port but it also affects legacy 10.2.X, !0.3.X & 10.4.X Apple builds of XFree86 (I know it affects 10.3.9 since my iMac G5 1.8 GHz with Super Drive originally shipped with an Apple 10.3.5 Restore DVD-ROM & the issue occurred under 10.4.7; I suspect it affects 10.2.X too but this is unconfirmed at this point).

The bug you reported is for OSX 10.4.

You referenced 2.3.0 in your description, but 2.3.0 won't even install on Tiger. Please upgrade to Leopard and try 2.3.1 or later and reopen if you experience this problem.
