Arma 2 Free trackpad not working
================================


I recently installed play on mac and I discovered that you run the actual programs with XQuartz. Anyway, I installed Arma 2 Free and I managed to get to the main menu. However, I can move the cursor around and it will show a summary of what each option does (for example: singleplayer: an offline blah blah blah...) however, when I click on the button, nothing happens. Please help.

1.  Trackpad click doesn't work.
2.  reconfigured everything, still doesn't work.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

Please ask for support on the mailing list.

XQuartz is at an abstraction layer above the hardware, so it shouldn't matter what mouse you use. They all look the same to us.

Does it work with other OS X apps? Does it work with other X11 apps? Use 'xinput test' and xev to debug.
