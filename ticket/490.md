XQuartz needs to code full path for ‘mktemp’ in 10-tmpdirs script.
==================================================================


I see the “history” of how GNU–coreutils is causing some headaches in some of the ports at Macports.  Here’s another one.

I initially had a much–bigger problem with XQuartz vs Apple–X11 as described by the entire thread starting at <http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/xquartz-dev/2011-April/003310.html>.

(I still don’t know how the “bad” DISPLAY value got into my system, but I made sure to “physically” disable the Apple–X11 plists as mentioned there.)

The rest of my problem boiled down to the use of ‘mktemp’ in the 10-tmpdirs script that the XQuartz.pkg installs into /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/privileged\_startx.d .

Since ‘mktemp’ is not coded with an absolute path in 10-tmpdirs, the script picks up the one I built from GNU–coreutils by my own hand (in /usr/local/bin here).  The GNU folks are stringently enforcing the XXXXX naming convention, which the 10-tmpdirs script does not follow (shame on that &lt;g&gt;).  This makes the 10-tmpdirs script fail, and a forever–bouncing XQuartz.app attempts to do the start-up process all over again, loop–de–loop.

I must allow use of the unmodified GNU–coreutils command names (e.g. no ‘g’ prefix) because of my huge amount of other open–source projects I’m tracking.  And I use XQuartz for much of them (besides, it is nicer than Apple–X11 &lt;g&gt;).

So the ‘fix’ here is to make sure the 10-tmpdirs script either:
(1)  uses GNU’s mktemp–enforced XXXXX naming conventions, which seems impossible because it’s in a ‘for’ loop using unconventional dir-names,
or
(2)  hard-code /usr/bin/mktemp in the 10-tmpdirs script.

I published a very simple patch to the mail-list to do the (2) thing, but it doesn’t seem to be in the latest versions of the XQuartz.pkg (2.6.3\_rc2 as I write this).  So I will open this bug-report and publish the simple patch here.  (This script was apparently re-written in 2.6.1 and later, I did not see this problem in 2.6.0 and before, so that’s why I’ve set this report with version=2.6.1.)

As mentioned in the mail-list, I feel this simple patch will match the rest of the scripts in XQuartz, which all seem to be coded with full absolute paths for the commands etc., as much as is possible.  But *this* one got missed for some reason.  ;)

Thank you.
