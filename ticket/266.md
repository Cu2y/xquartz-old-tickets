Wine & 3D rendering: Screen lines, flickering, image pushed to top, seems to be DirectX to openGL related
=========================================================================================================


Wine & 3D rendering: Screen lines, flickering, image pushed to top, seems to be DirectX to openGL related

I have been trying to get a game (Ragnarok Online Specifically) to work with wine on Mac OS X. I have been trying with all 3 versions of wine available on MacPorts and event manual builds or those bundled with Darwine and PlayOnMac.

System details:
Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.7
XQuartz 2.3.3.2
Wine (1.0.1 & 1.1.21 & Crossover)

Till recently i could only get the patcher working. But with the latest OS X update (10.5.7) and the latest XQuartz i have been able to open the game and play.

However after a few seconds of rendering the the image distorts and bright lines (mainly red) appear every where pushing the image to the upper half section of the rendering area and also has distorted image duplication elsewhere.

As you can see i tried this with a variety of wine versions and get the same issue, so i believe the wine implementation isn't the problem.

I have attached a screen shot of the problem. Surprisingly there were no problems spat out onto the STDOUT.

Does this happen with Crossover Games as well? If so, then it's highly likely a wine issue since Crossover doesn't use our new libGL.

If you're saying that it USED to work with Codeweavers' but doesn't any more, then that is disturbing news and means that something we changed in libXplugin had this effect (which would be a tad confusing)

Please clarify those two points and also attach your system profile (Apple-&gt;About This Mac-&gt;More Info (to open up System Profiler), File-&gt;Save As).

No I'm saying I could never get it to work originally.
Never could get the openGL rendering window to come up, always had errors within wine.
This remained the same against all version of wine.

Then the new updates for Leopard and new XQuartz were available (still same versions of wine).
I now can get the openGL window to come up, however i have the render box flickering issue.
This remains the same across all version of wine that i had tried previously.

I believe this is not a wine issue since this specific game has worked across many other platforms and their implementation of X11 with the wine implementations I have tried. Though the only difference is my mac and the X11 implementation.

I have seen however some people have managed to get it to work with a fully licensed crossover implementation. I do not have this implementation. I got my crossover implementation from MacPorts.

The reason I have submitted this bug is to help identify the possible cause of this issue. And look forward to help in any way i can as it seems the implementation is so close.

So let me know if you have any other questions <sup>\_</sup>

Codeweavers has a different libGL and X11 server in their implementation, so that is probably why others have gotten it to work with the Codeweavers licensed version. Codeweavers lets you try their version free for 30 days, so I suggest you give that a try. If it works, then we know the issue is in our server or libGL.

Have you updated to Snow Leopard? If so, please give 2.5.1\_beta1 a whirl (<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL>) as it has some updates to GLX which might address this.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

Unless you can confirm that this is not a wine bug, there's nothing I can do. Please test wine under linux or Crossover Games.

I couldn't get it to run under Codeweavers Crossover Games 8.1.4.
I can reproduce the problem under 2.5.1\_beta2.

It looks like the process maybe gets the GLX context but then doesn't actually draw to it...
