Can't open display 'local:0.0'
==============================


Hello, I am trying to ssh into a remote computer running RedHat. I think my problem is that the program I wish to run remotely is java based. Do I need a Xvfb to be installed in XQuartz?

I just switched to OSX Mountain Lion and could no longer use X11 which did not have this problem. All I had to do was: xhost remote \[break\], ssh username@remote \[break\], then set the display to my ipaddress.

Maybe I have to use different commands?

Join the x11-users mailing list and explain what you're trying to do.

You should be able to just ssh into the remote machine with X11 forwarding, and it should "just work"

Your "local:0.0" in the title of this bug is just wrong.
