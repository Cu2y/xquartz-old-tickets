xinitrc retains zombie process until user quits X11
===================================================


This is a patch for xinitrc in X11-2.1.4. The execution of
"/usr/X11/bin/font\_cache.sh" as a background process in xinitrc
unnecessarily leaves behind a zombie process until the user quits
X11, at which point launchd reaps it. Of course, a zombie process
is not the end of the world.

However, if executing "/usr/X11/bin/font\_cache.sh" in the background
is the objective, then I would suggest to do this in a subshell so
that the process can be orphaned, allowing launchd to adopt and
wait for it. This what the xinitrc.patch causes to happen.

    Before patch:
    % pstree -s X11
    -+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd
     \-+= 00072 jneitzel /sbin/launchd
       \-+= 00102 jneitzel /bin/bash --login /usr/X11/bin/startx
         \-+- 00128 jneitzel xinit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- -nolisten   ...
           |--= 00129 jneitzel /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11...
           \-+= 00132 jneitzel /usr/bin/quartz-wm
             \--- 00138 jneitzel (sh)

    After patch:
    % pstree -s X11
    -+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd
     \-+= 00072 jneitzel /sbin/launchd
       \-+= 00744 jneitzel /bin/bash --login /usr/X11/bin/startx
         \-+- 00769 jneitzel xinit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- -nolisten   ...
           |--= 00770 jneitzel /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11...
           \--= 00773 jneitzel /usr/bin/quartz-wm

This is done in startx and not xinitrc as of about a month ago. I'll make these changes in startx.
