Bluetooth:Not Availiable
========================


My Mac: Macbook Pro Mid 2011
My OS version: OS X 10.8.2
X11 version: 2.7.4

Dear XQuartz,

Originally I've purchased an app named OPlayer, it's work fine and I can use it to view the VCD.

But after I upgrade my Mac OS to Mountain Lion (10.8.2), and when I execute the OPlayer, there had a system prompt to me that OPlayer no longer support OS X11, and ask me to install the newest version. After several google enquiry, I've install the XQuartz project new version 2.7.4. The OPlayer then works normally and I enjoy the video viewing again. Unfortunally, I found my Magic Mouse not work. I check the bluetooth icon at the top menu, it always show 'Bluetooth: Not Availiable". I've try several way to diagnostics my bluetooth device such as reset NVM, XCode bluetooth tools to reset all link keys and perform Full Factory Reset as well, but it seems my mac bluetooth host controller still not resume service.

I really new to Mac but I love Mac, I'm sincere to create this ticket and look for the advice from Xquartz support team , please help me and teach me how to solve my problem.

Thanks in advance.

David

XQuartz has nothing to do with bluetooth. Please contact AppleCare.
