Xquartz 2.5.3 crashes when using spaces with xcrysden taking mac os x wm along with it
======================================================================================


Xcrysden 1.5.21 (which is a very popular program in theoretical solid state physics community) crashes Xquartz 2.5.3 when you switch desktop with spaces.

The problem is not completely with the Xcrysden crashing, when the Xquartz crashes, it takes the wm of mac osx with it, all the unsaved information is lost. Quite nasty situation.

The error can be replicated using the apple suplied xquartz and other operating systems

The logs indicate something like this:

Exception Type: EXC\_BAD\_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes: KERN\_INVALID\_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000058
Crashed Thread: 2

You have given insufficient information. Can you please attach the crash log. Also, can you please try with 2.6.0\_alpha2 (<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.6.0_alpha2.dmg>)
