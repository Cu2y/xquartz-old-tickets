dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
=======================================================


I suspect it may not be the first report on this issue, but since migrating to a Snow Leopard Mac from my Leopard machine, I've had trouble running several X11 packages, the latest being 'xfig'. Here's some info:

% fink -V

Package manager version: 0.29.9

Distribution version: selfupdate-rsync Mon Jan 18 16:18:50 2010, 10.6, i386

% dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib

> Referenced from: /sw/bin/xfig
> Reason: Incompatible library version: xfig requires version 38.0.0 or later, but libpng12.0.dylib provides version 36.0.0

I tried the usual selfupdate and scanpackages, as well as upgrading fink to the latest distro, but still no luck.

yeah, 2.4.0 includes bits that are newer than shipped with SL. Rebuild your fink. X11 in SL will not be clobbering the system X11, so this will no longer be an issue.
