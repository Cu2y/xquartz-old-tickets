Integrate application's menu into OS X menu bar
===============================================


It would be nice if quartz-wm/Xquartz can integrate the focussed X application's menu into the menu bar. This would be similar to the way Unity/Gnome3 manages to integrate the application's menu into it's title bar and of course the way OS X works.

That's not possible.
