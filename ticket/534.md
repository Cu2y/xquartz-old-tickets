Move XQuartz.app from dock to status bar
========================================


Currently, when using any X application, XQuartz starts up, along with the application in the dock.
This is both confusing to new users, ones who don't understand the point of XQuartz, and (subjective opinion) is a pain to look at and use.
I therefore request we take XQuartz out of the dock, and shove it into the status bar, in the way that CygWin puts shows it xserver in it's status dock.
See attached screenshot.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.7.0 (xserver-1.11.2)*
-   **Milestone** set to *later*

If you want to work on this, patches are welcome, but please make it configurable. This is not something that I am likely to spend my limited X development time on, however.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
