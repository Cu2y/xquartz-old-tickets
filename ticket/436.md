xcb error causes application crash
==================================


Hi,

A crucial (for me) X11 application crashes in the newer versions of Xquartz.

This app, called nmrDraw, exits with the following error in 2.5.1-2.5.3:

*Assertion failed: (ret != inval\_id), function \_XAllocID, file xcb\_io.c, line 461.
Abort*

It worked perfectly fine up to and including 2.5.0.
I don't know anything about x11 or this apps inner workings so I'm afraid I can't tell you anything more than this error message.

I guess it is related to new version of libxcb in the version 2.5.1 and up.

I have reverted to 2.5.0 in order to being able to work.

Any help much appreciated,

Cheers,

Hugo van Ingen

-   **Priority** changed from *Blocker* to *Expected*
-   **Component** changed from *xserver* to *x11-libs*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.0*

It's more likely releated to the fact that libX11 is using libxcb in version 2.5.1 and up.

Can you please tell me what application you are running and how to reproduce the problem?

Ah, sorry I missed it the first time. It is nmrDraw. Can you please tell me how you installed it (from source, download, etc) and how to reproduce the problem. Are you on Leopard or Snow Leopard?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

This is a bug in XView (ie outside of X11 itself). It just happened to work for you in the past. The problem is not unique to OSX and involves fixing the antiquated XView library (which is pretty much defunct). Your options are:

1) Fix XView

2) Convince the developers of the nmrDraw application to abandon the 20 year old toolkit for something slightly more modern and supported
