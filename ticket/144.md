Unsure if these crashes are from the same problem..

I ran into this crash too. After it happened the launchd socket went dead; also, the new X server started as :1. I can start clients if I set DISPLAY=:1, but things do not seem in good shape.

(BTW, answering the questions you asked on x11-users about this bug: I'm on a MacBook Pro with only the internal keyboard and trackpad; "Follow system keyboard layout" was off at the time of the crash.)

Not sure if the two are related; if not I can file another bug. This is what I get trying to start X11 again:

com-macosforge: Your server is reporting that it is 1.4.0-apple14. That is an old version from an earlier rc. Did you install 2.3.0?

I assumed I installed 2.3.0 as /Applications/Utilities/X11.app claims to be 2.3.0 and the package receipt claims to be 2.3.0 too, but:

    % ls -l /usr/X11/bin/Xquartz
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    44K Jun  7 23:55 /usr/X11/bin/Xquartz*
    % strings Xquartz|grep 1.4.0
    1.4.0-apple14

Sorry for the confusion, but it's hopefully understandable and the version numbers can be reported correctly in future!

(I was able to reproduce the above problem with the older server repeatedly, but doing the same thing with 2.3.0 I haven't been able to reproduce it at all yet.)

Ok, please reopen if this happens with the real 2.3.0.

Thanks.

Actually, reopening... I forgot that the original report \*WAS\* with 2.3.0.

pc: What keyboard do you have? What layout do you have selected? Do you have "follow system keyboard layout" enabled in X11 preferences? Did you change the layout while X11 was running? Did this crash occur during startup or after X11 had been running for a while? Is there any way you can reliably reproduce this crash?

Replying to [jeremyhu@freedesktop.org](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/144#comment:9):

> pc: What keyboard do you have?

Regular UK Apple keyboard

> What layout do you have selected?

\*Probably\* the regular US one. I tend to use Alt shift to get at the UK Pound symbol

> Do you have "follow system keyboard layout" enabled in X11 preferences?

No.

> Did you change the layout while X11 was running?

Not as far as I can remember

> Did this crash occur during startup or after X11 had been running for a while?

After running for a while

> Is there any way you can reliably reproduce this crash?

Sadly no. It hasn't happened since I reported it...

Ok, well I'm going to close this then... Changes in 2.3.1 change a bit how this function gets called, so hopefully it's gone. If not, I'll need to see it crash in 2.3.1 for more information.

This is reported as still present on the users list. Please see this post for info on how you can help debug this:

For those of you who experienced this while X11 was running (not the old at-startup bug), do you have tablets?

Also, I updated the binary drop. Please test out:

Sweet. Finally crushed... just one more crash to clear up... =)
