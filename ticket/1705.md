Blinking popup window when using Ctrl+N in Intellij on 2nd monitor
==================================================================


On Mac OS X 10.9.3, with XQuartz 2.7.6
I use X11-Forwarding to run Intellij 13.1.3 (latest) running with Java 1.7.0\_45 on Centos 6.5 in Virtualbox.
Once Intellij starts, i drag it over to a second monitor.
Then I use the "Navigate to File" or "Navigate to Class" feature by hitting Ctrl+N or Ctrl+Shift+N or selecting from the menu.
The popup always appears on the 'main' screen, which is a problem.
However, the bigger problem is that, intermittently, that popup window appears to be "blinking" or getting repeatedly redrawn. At the same time it is not taking any input. Hitting Escape or clicking outside of this popup, closes it, and, if the commend is invoked again, the window may come up properly or blink again.
Please let me know where i can find the logs and i will gladly provide them.

Here is the video demonstrating the correct and problematic behavior (in order)
<http://youtu.be/WL8UF2LFGXU>

Moreover:
Upon further testing, I found that the following:
1) problem happens when using NXFree with NoMachine client, or X2GO client/server, even with a single monitor or a floating window
3) problem does not happen when using Cygwin Xserver

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Not To Be Fixed*

As the issue happens with just the one client and many X11 servers and not just XQuartz, I suggest you work with the developers of the application to adddres the issue.

I think you misunderstood.
X2GO relies on XQuartz.
I am not 100% certain, but I think NoMachine bundles Xquartz on the mac as well.
Moreover, the application works fine under XOrg X Server.
Moreover still, Intellij is written in Java and therefore relies on platform agnostic graphic APIs.

Thus, I disagree that the problem should or can be addressed by Intellij developers.

Please consider reopening this ticket.

This is also reportedly happening with a single X11 client. I suggest you work with intellij developers to triage the issue. If it is a server issue, they can probably come up with a fix that we can integrate.

could you please clarify what you mean by 'single X11 client'? and by 'reportedly', are you referring to my report or someone else's?

Thanks

By "single X11 client," I mean that the only X11 client experiencing this issue is Intellij.

By "reportedly," I mean that your report only mentions this happening with Intellij, and there have been no other reports of similar issues.

I have just performed a test where I opened Intellij via X11-forwarding using a Centos **client**. I was not able to reproduce the issue. Since Centos is using the XOrg X Server, it seems to me that the problem is specific to the XQuartz X server.

Therefore, I doubt that Intellij developers are likely to look into this bug. I am not an expert in the X Windows and graphics domain, so I might be wrong here. Could you please help me make the make the case to them that they should look into this even though it is not reproducible under the XOrg which is basically the reference X Server implementation.

I do appreciate your time and fast responses.

> using a Centos client

I think you're mixing up the server/client model here. This is a common misunderstanding about the X11 architecture.

What system is running the server in your working case? Are you sshing from your CentOS machine running its Xorg server to an OS X machine running your Intellij client to see this behaving correctly?

> Since Centos is using the XOrg X Server, it seems to me that the problem is specific to the XQuartz X server.

The XQuartz X server is the X.org X Server. XQuartz is one of many ddx. It is quite possible that the issue is inside of the XQuartz ddx, but your report that it happens "using NXFree with NoMachine client, or X2GO client/server" make me suspect otherwise.

> Therefore, I doubt that Intellij developers are likely to look into this bug.

Well, for the exact same reason (the fact that the issue only happens with their X11 client) and the severe lack of development resources available for XQuartz, it's not really feasible to sink resources into triaging this issue. I'm certainly willing to help out the Intellij developers with triage and come up with a solution if they isolate the problem.

Even if it is a bug in the XQuartz DDX, I don't really have the resources to investigate this issue given that it is only happening with a single client. Your best chance at getting this addressed is by working with the application developers.

Since Centos is using the XOrg X Server, it seems to me that the problem is specific to the XQuartz X server.

Gotcha. Thank you, I understand the issue better now and will try to get the interest of Intellij developers, even though i really doubt they will be interested because it's a very narrow use-case for them.

Thanks again for your time.

One more thing - are there any relevant XQuartz logs that I should look into so that I can reference them in a bug report to Intellij?

Check the Xquartz and quartz-wm man pages for information on how to get verbose logs from those two processes. Also, you might want to try using xscope to log traffic between the server and client so we can see what is being communicated to cause that issue. That may point to some event being sent repeatedly to the client for some reason which might narrow down the issue to whatever in XQuartz is responsible for sending that event.
