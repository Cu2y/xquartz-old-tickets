X11 windows unreachable when switching from external monitor to laptop monitor
==============================================================================


Occasionally (used loosely, because I haven't found the exact steps to reproduce this effect) when I go from using an external monitor (which has higher resolution) to the laptop monitor (with a sleep cycle in between), the X11 windows are unreachable. I can see them fly by as I switch spaces, but they don't appear in any particular space. This is something new I've seen with XQuartz 2.6.0 in Mac OSX 10.6.5 and 10.6.6. This may be a related to [\#⁠460](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/460), although I don't completely understand everything said there.

Yeah, this should be fixed at the same time as [\#⁠460](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/460)

The fix for [\#⁠460](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/460) is in git and will be in the next release. I urge you to test the first release candidates of 2.6.1 to verify that this issue actually has the same underlying cause as [\#⁠460](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/460). Since I'm not able to reproduce this exact issue, I'm working under the assumption that it is a duplicate of [\#⁠460](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/460).

Thanks.

Just happened again. I noticed this time that I had a pop-up notification from iCal when I logged in on the laptop. The next time I am back at my external screen, I will check if this makes the effect reproducible.

When I tried to reproduce the effect by plugging in my external monitor, then unplugging it, the effect didn't happen; however, plugging the external monitor back in did crash X11.

Yeah, I could see that happening. Please try beta1 when it's released to test the fix.

(2.6.1\_beta1) ... currently waiting for libpng-2.5.1 before releasing it.
