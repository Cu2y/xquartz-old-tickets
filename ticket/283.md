glabels: xterm errors-glabels errors then program won't load file configurations.
=================================================================================


The following error messages are displayed first in the terminal window, then when glabels actually starts the last 2 messages comes up in a window on top of the glabels window.

---

Rogue-Caravan:~ sardior$ glabels
Xlib: extension "RANDR" missing on display "/tmp/launch-QPi35c/:0".
Dynamic session lookup supported but failed: launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded!

(glabels:18672): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkSpinButton: setting an adjustment with non-zero page size is deprecated
**

---

An error occurred while loading or saving configuration information for glabels. Some of your configuration settings may not work properly.

Failed to contact configuration server; some possible causes are that you need to enable TCP/IP networking for ORBit, or you have stale NFS locks due to a system crash. See <http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/> for information. (Details - 1: Failed to get connection to session: Not enough memory)

---

It will not load glabels files and each time I try to load an Avery Template I get the second two messages again.

org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded. I have 4G of memory and an active tcp/ip connection to the internet and my intranet. I have rebooted my computer and this still comes up.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

This has nothing to do with X11. But I'll still give you a hand. As the output you copied states,

"launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded!"

So, make sure that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded. If you installed this from macports, the dbus port told you how to do this when it finished installing. If you're uncertain, reinstall it and it'll be the last line:

    sudo port -v -f uninstall dbus
    sudo port -v install dbus
