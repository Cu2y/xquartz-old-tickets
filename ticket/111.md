X11 opens twice on launch after update from 2.1.1
=================================================


After upgrading to 2.2.1, Every time I open X11 it launches two identical instances of the program. Both are the X11 that is in the Utilities folder. I had a custom .xinitrc file, but even after disabling it the behavior continues.

You probably are setting $DISPLAY somewhere in your environment. open Terminal.app. What does 'echo $DISPLAY' say? What do you see in Console.app pertaining to X11?
