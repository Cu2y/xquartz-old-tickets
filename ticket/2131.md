Full screen mode - exits fullscreen randomly
============================================


I run Exceed on Demand in XQuartz 2.7.7 using full-screen mode. Randomly during usage the XQuartz window disappears (as if I pressed Cmd-Option-a). I am running Mavericks (10.9.5), and Yosemite (10.10.3). It happens on both. I am using a MBP Early 2013 with NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M.

Some of my settings:
Colors: From Display
Full-screen mode: Check
Auto-show menu bar: Not Checked
Click-through inactive Windows: Not Checked
Focus Follows Mouse: Not Checked
Focus On New Windows: Checked
