2.5.1\_rc1 segfaults on remote xterm. Also mouse cursor goes fuzzy
==================================================================


If I remote ssh to an xterm hosted from a
linux box, mousing around the borders
turns the mouse fuzzy, then shortly after a
segfault happens....
Doesn't happen in previous release: all is fine
Happens very predictably.

% ssh -X me@remote xterm &

excerpt from stderr dump of X11 in terminal....

    DISPLAY= :8

-   **Description** modified

Does it happen immediately, or do you need to close the xterm, run a few of them?

can you please explain what you mean by "mousing around the borders" ... I want to reproduce this issue, but I'm having difficulty.

Thanks.

Also, if you could include the crash log, that would help out. Check in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports or ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter

Would you mind giving me more reproduction info? Can you reliably reproduce this? If so, can you please attach to X11.bin with gdb, break in malloc\_error\_break, and trigger the crash... then report the backtrace to me.
