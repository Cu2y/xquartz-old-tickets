"Minimise to application icon" doesn't work
===========================================


X11 windows only minimise to the right hand side of the dock, even though I have "Minimize windows into application icon" option selected in the Dock System Preferences pane.

Hopefully I can attach a screenshot. If so, it shows the window minimized to the dock, rather than behind the X icon, and the related preference.

This isn't something that can be addressed by X11.
