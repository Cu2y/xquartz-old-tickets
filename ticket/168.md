X11.app doesn't quit automatically when exiting a window manager
================================================================


Environment: X11 has the initial xterm disabled, and only a single window manager invoked from .xinitrc. Using Enlightenment window manager.

Quitting the window manager from its X11-based menus results in X11.app just running idle until it is quit manually.

In Apple's stock 10.5.4 or 10.5.5 implementation. quitting the window manager would cause X11.app to quit also.

Discussed on the X11-users list, opening bug report at Jeremy's request.
