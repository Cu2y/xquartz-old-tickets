wine opengl application does not work
=====================================


I try to run an opengl application in wine (1.1.44) on mac os x snow leopard using xquartz on a mac mini server.

It's a coin standard application (www.coin3d.org) which runs under wine in linux but not on the mac. Starting the application (the app is coin-based, coin 3.1.0 or later, SoWin 1.3 or later) leads to the following message box:

Coin warning in SoWinGLWidgetP::wglMakeCurrent(): The rendering context &lt;000001F8, 0012F030&gt;, could not be made current, as wglMakeCurrent() failed with error message: Success.

After that other message boxes appear, the last is:

Could not find any supported OpenGL mode on your system. Application will exit.

After that the application terminates.

To test it yourself, I can send you the application. Also I can send the source codes and the project files if it helps. Please let me know how I can help solving this issue ...

this is a RANDR issue... you do not have the modes because there is no real RANDR support in Xquartz (which is very sad :( )

Try configuring Wine to run in a virtual desktop window (in winecfg.exe) and see if it fixes the issue.... as long as you don't want to run fullscreen this could work.

but... Coin3D lists native Mac version of 3.1.3 available for download... do you really need Wine and the Windows version?

I'm not so familiar with winecfg but I changed it to virtual desktop but there was no change in behavior. The same error occurs.

> but... Coin3D lists native Mac version of 3.1.3 available for download... do you really need Wine and the Windows version?

Your remark that coin3d is available for Mac is right, but the use case I need it for is a windows application that uses coin3d and can't be ported natively to Mac OS X. To make a solution/analyses of the problem easier I reduced it to a standard windows coin3d application problem without any additional overhead. So a solution for this problem would be fine :-) and should enable a class of 3d-applications ...

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

with the virtual desktop, wine should see only one resolution (the one set as the virtual desktop). Try setting the size of the VD to be the size requested. In any event, this will be fixed once we have RandR support.

> when you're program calls to change resolution in a Virtual Desktop, the window should automatically resize to the right resolution...

if its still not seeing the proper modes.... how did you get Wine? are you sure OpenGL support was compiled in correctly? In a Virtual Desktop you usually cannot get that error unless OpenGL is just missing altogether.
