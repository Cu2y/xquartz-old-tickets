Using Pymol on two screens, the main screen display is corrupted
================================================================


I am currently using xorg-server 1.7.5 and pymol build both with macports. (Same issue with 1.7.4 and XQuartz 2.3.4)
Here is the issue, when my second screen is plugged in, the entire display on the screen of my laptop becomes jammed when I launch pymol (I tried to make a screenshot, but it doesn't show anything).
If I can move the opengl window of pymol on my second screen, everything is back to normal. If I bring it back to main screen, it is jammed again.
This does not happen when there is no screen plugged in.
I think the bug should easy to reproduce by installing everything needed from macports.
I am using a Macbookpro 4,1 with OS X 10.6.2.
Thanks for your attention,
Olivier
