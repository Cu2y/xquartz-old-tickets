NX not working with 2.5.0 beta2
===============================


I recently upgraded to 10.6. The NX client was working fine with the stock Snow Leopard X11. I then installed XQuartz 2.5.0 beta2 `XQuartz 2.5.0_beta2 (xorg-server 1.7.4.901)` and ever since I am getting:

    NXPROXY - Version 3.4.0

    Copyright (C) 2001, 2010 NoMachine.
    See http://www.nomachine.com/ for more information.

    Info: Proxy running in client mode with pid '37787'.
    Session: Starting session at 'Thu Mar 18 17:43:17 2010'.
    Error: Can't determine the location of the X display socket.
    Error: Error 2 'No such file or directory' checking '/tmp/launch-TzsQvD/org.macosforge.xquartz'.
    Session: Session terminated at 'Thu Mar 18 17:43:18 2010'.

I'm not sure how NX tries to figure out where to look for the socket, since there is actually a `/tmp/launch-TzsQvD/org.macosforge.xquartz:0` but not a `/tmp/launch-TzsQvD/org.macosforge.xquartz`:

    $ ls -la /tmp/launch-TzsQvD/
    total 0
    drwx------   3 adavid wheel  102 Mar 15 16:01 .
    drwxrwxrwt 163 root   wheel 5542 Mar 18 17:42 ..
    srwx------   1 adavid wheel    0 Mar 15 16:01 org.macosforge.xquartz:0

I wonder if this is a problem on the XQuartz side in some utility which tells where programs should look for the socket.

Thanks!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.0*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

As mentioned on the mailing list, the fix will need to come from NoMachine. NoMachine is "told" the socket by the $DISPLAY environment variable.
