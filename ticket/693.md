Mac windows stay visible when switching to full screen mode
===========================================================


I use X11 only in full screen mode. I also multiple desktops. Here is what works:

-   go to the desktop where X was started
-   switch to X with command-tab

Here is what not works:

-   go to any other desktop
-   switch to X with command-tab

Result in the second case:

-   you see the slide to the correct desktop
-   X windows become vislbe
-   but underneath the regular Finder windows are still visible.
-   switching out of / back into full screen fixes it since now we're on the right desktop

Is this still an issue with Mavericks?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
