DISPLAY variable keeps changing (2.7.5)
=======================================


Hi,

I upgraded to OSX Mavericks, and my XQuartz 2.7.2 still worked nicely. Today I received the upgrade notification, so I did as I was told –

And now there's this strange problem: When repeatedly opening and closing XQuartz, the DISPLAY keeps counting up. I can see this by opening an xterm (from XQuartz's dropdown menu) and checking "set | grep DISPLAY".

-   During the first run of XQuartz, it's ":0", so I can run other X applications from a regular Mac terminal.

<!-- -->

-   During the second run of XQuartz, it's ":1". I can open a new xterm from XQuartz's dropdown menu (simply to check the DISPLAY variable).

<!-- -->

-   But when I'm in a OSX terminal, the DISPLAY variable still points to ":0:0", and thus any X application will report " Can't open display: :0.0", unless I change it manually to the currently correct value via "export DISPLAY=:2" or whatever the current correct value might be.

Additional information:

-   When I run XQuartz and quit it the regular way, it will count up the next time.

<!-- -->

-   However, if I kill the X11.bin process (e.g. by running /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS manually and killing it with Ctrl-C), the counter will remain unchanched during the next run.

OK, went on googling and checked /opt/X11/bin/startx which tries to determine an unused $DISPLAY in lines 125+ by checking /tmp/.X$d-lock.

-   Long story short: On my iMac with OSX Mavericks, XQuartz 2.7.5 **does not delete** its .X0-lock when the X server terminates.

Don't set DISPLAY yourself. It should be set to the launchd socket by launchd. See this FAQ for help finding where you're setting it.

Agreed – defining your own DISPLAY variable is something that MacPorts recommends to be put into ~/.profile.

*However –*

XQuartz 2.7.5 not deleting its .X0-lock at the end of its termination should definitely be considered a bug. I reckon that this circumstance is too hidden in my ticket above. I'll open a new one for it, OK?

That is \*DEFINITELY\* not true.

yes, please do.

I don't think too much changed in xinit, so I'm curious why we would be seeing this now...

I simply changed startx to clean up stale lock files:
07:58:46\[1097\]crabapple:/opt/X11/bin&gt; diff startx.orig startx
128c128,131

&lt; \[ -e /tmp/.X$d-lock \]

break

---

> > \[ ! -e /tmp/.X$d-lock \] && break \# no lock file, good display
> > \[ ! -s /tmp/.X$d-lock \] && { rm /tmp/.X$d-lock; break; } \# bogus if empty
> > \# check that PID in lock file is valid, otherwise clean up lock file
> >
> > kill -0 "`tr -d ' \12' </tmp/.X$d-lock`"
> >
> > { rm /tmp/.X$d-lock; break; }

After this change, the display number no longer increments (which was very annoying given that I want to be able to derive a suitable DISPLAY value for remote display back without ssh tunneling from the :\# suffix on the supplied DISPLAY variable).
