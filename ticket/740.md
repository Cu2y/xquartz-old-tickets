Still no answer to ticket 723
=============================


I submitted ticket 723 for xQuartz crashing and heard nothing. I submitted ticket 738 as a followup. This resulted in my original ticket being closed and the followup ticket also being closed. Can someone please tell me what I need to do to make xQuartz work? I really don't want to rebuild the machine to correct what is probably a quick fix.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

Opening new tickets to respond to old ones it not appropriate.

Your environment is messed up. As shown in [\#⁠723](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/723), the failing assertion is:

    char *home = getenv("HOME");
    assert(home);

I have no idea how you managed to get your system into that state, but it has nothing to do with XQuartz. We're just aborting because of the problem.
