Space key must be pressed twice in Xephyr with -kb
==================================================


Xeyphr requires space to be pressed twice in order to register once. This behaviour occurs when launching with

$ startx /usr/X11/bin/twm -- /usr/X11/bin/Xephyr :20 -kb

This behaviour is also observed when I try using Xephyr to connect via XDMCP to a RH 4u3 machine running GNOME desktop with the command

$ Xephyr :20 -kb -once -query remotehost

Omitting the -kb option in either case causes the keyboard to produce incoherent input.

System: Mac OS X 10.5.4 with Xquartz 2.3 installed

-   **Summary** changed from *Space key must be pressed twice in Xephyr* to *Space key must be pressed twice in Xephyr with -kb*
-   **Priority** changed from *major* to *minor*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.2*

Don't use -kb as a command line argument and you should be fine.

Oh, I just saw your note about incoherent input. Install 2.3.1\_rc2 and use '-kb' ... I'm guessing you were using 2.3.0.

I am seeing this issue as well, even after installing RC2. Without -kb it works fine now. I am trying to use Xephyr for XDMCP (like the original submitter) and with or without -kb, I get garbled text in the XDMCP GNOME session.

Installing 2.3.1\_rc3 appears to have solved the issue with requiring -kb option to get coherent keyboard input.
However using -kb option still requires space key to be pressed twice.

Is this still happening with 2.4.0\_rc1?

I only have the 2.3.3.2 installed on my system. The issue no longer occurs in that release. The keyboard also produces correct results with or without the -kb option.
