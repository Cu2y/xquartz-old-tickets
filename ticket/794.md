XQuartz wont install on Mountain Lion 10.8.5
============================================


I am trying to install XQuartz 2.7.5 from the package on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 but I am stuck at a screen during installation which asks, "How do you want to install this software" and the option is grayed out and there is no other option to select and I cannot proceed forward with the installaton.

I am attaching a screenshot aswell.
