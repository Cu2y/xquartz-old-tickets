OSX 10.5.7 update killed X11, can't restore
===========================================


I recently installed the latest Leopard OSX update to 10.5.7. Since then, X11 has not worked correctly. X11 turns the entire desktop into a black and white dithered pattern with one xterm window and does not give access to any Mac functions, requiring a restart. I have removed and re-installed to the latest X11-2.3.3.2 but it doesn't help.

You're in fullscreen. Hit cmd-alt-a or choose "Leave Fullscreen" from the X11 menu. Then go into preferences and disable fullscreen mode.
