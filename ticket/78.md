Loss of window focus with expose
================================


To reproduce:

1.  Launch two copies of `xterm` (Now called 1 and 2)
2.  Move them so that 1 is front of 2 and partially obscuring it
3.  Use expose (all windows) to and pick 2. It comes forward
4.  Now click on 2 (which is in front) on an area which is directly overtop of 1
5.  2 will lose focus and 1 comes forward
