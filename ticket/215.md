X11 Applications menu: support for multiple elements in commands
================================================================


2.3.2-rc4 changed the way that commands in the Applications menu are exec'd so that only a single command will work. Prior to this, one could string commands together, e.g.,

source /sw/bin/init.sh; xfig -geometry 100x100+10+20

Since the environment-setting part has been necessary in the past, many people will have menu items like this that will break. The source ... is no longer needed if the user has an appropriate .profile or equivalent for their login shell \[I don't actually know if this is true for other shells since mine is bash\] but people won't know they have to fix their menu items unless they are explicitly told. Also, some may have used this feature to configure other sorts of multiple command menu items.
