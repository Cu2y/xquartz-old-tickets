XQ 2.7.5 doesn't set $DISPLAY
=============================


After installing XQuartz 2.7.5 on a 10.9.1 XServe I can no longer start an X11 session; xterm returns "no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable"

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

Did you logout like the installer instructed you to?

Yes, i logged out several times. Plus I reinstalled XQ 2.7.5, logging out and/or rebooting each time. I solved the problem by editing /etc/sshd\_config:

X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes

These three lines were commented out.

You probably should've mentioned the issue you were having was with ssh in the report ;)
