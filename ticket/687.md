Crashes at GeForceGLDriver / Macbook Pro / Mountain Lion QuartzComposer
=======================================================================


Hi all. I am experiencing a problem with my Macbook Pro - issues with the gfx-card. My suspicion is, that this has got something to do with the XQuartz-driver. Before Mountain Lion everything was fine - after MT Lion update, Quartz Composer forced my to update to XQuartz. Since then I am having troubles, but only at some features on the graphic card. The problems occur with i.e. meshes at QuartzComposer. I also have problems with Fonts and Sprites at Love2D (<http://www.love2d.org>). I have a Macbook Pro 5,5 and some collegue of mine was having the same kind of problem - especially when trying to open Quartz Composer, then choosing template, then selecting "mesh composition". This leads to a software crash. My love2D issues let the app stutter first, than stutter more and finally a hard crash with "kernel panic".

I attached the crash-reposrts. The issues still persist at my system - so I can test things.

GFX-Card:
NVIDIA GeForce 9400M:

Quartz Composer has nothing to do with XQuartz.

That kernel panic looks like a graphics driver bug.

Report this to <http://bugreport.apple.com>

Well then, but why did I had to install XQuartz on the first launch of Quartz Composer? I also tried to update everything that looks related to the gfx-card - also latest drivers from NVidia. Is this in the end maybe a OS-X bug?

My guess is that it was something else causing you to install XQuartz and not Quartz Composer.

Graphics drivers are provided with OS updates, so I'm not sure what you mean by "latest drivers from NVidia" ... please report this to Apple with the link I provided.

Ok, thanks a lot. Will made a bug report at apple then!
