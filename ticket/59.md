Xephyr doesn't refresh image with colormap change
=================================================


I'm trying to replicate an old 8-bit framebuffer behavior (on Solaris) for an image processing package called IDL. Users like the behavior in which changing the color table with a tool will immediately / dynamically change the colors shown in the image also displayed in a separate window. Really, I think it is changing all the system colors, in the simple 8-bit shared colormap.

I've read that 8-bit / 256 color Preferences doesn't work in x11, and to try Xephyr. I'm doing that. It is really close to giving me what I'm looking for. The thing is, the color in the image doesn't change immediately, but if I move the mouse over the image, it "paints" out an area under the mouse cursor (about 4x the size of the cross) of the new color. That is, as I wave the mouse over the picture, it is magically painted out in the new colors which I selected when I used the color adjustment tool. So, the colors are changing in some sense, but the mouse is doing something (refreshing the image under the cursor?) so as to show the new colors.

I think that changes to the shared colormap should be immediately apparent in everything on the screen that is using that shared colormap. It is apparent that the image actually is, and that painting it with the mouse cursor is revealing a bug.

Thanks,
==Leonard
