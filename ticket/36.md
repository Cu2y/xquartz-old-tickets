Accented characters not applied on letters (i.e. on greek keyboard)
===================================================================


If you select a non-american (greek) keyboard layout and try to apply an accented character, this character is not placed on letter.

How to reproduce this bug:
1) Enable greek keyboard layout
2) Switch to greek keyboard from the menu, since the keyboard equivalence does not work
3) Type \[accent\]+\[a\] (accent is character ";")

The expected result is ά, while the produced is 'α (two characters).

So... is \[accent\] (;) a modifier key on the greek keyboard? I'm a bit confused on how to handle this...

No response from submitter regarding testing requests. The input code has gone through a big update since the reported version. Closing. If this is still an issue, test with 2.3.2\_beta2 and reopen.
