Menu bar shows up in full screen mode (mountain lion)
=====================================================


In mountain lion, cmd-tab to switch from another application to Xquartz full-screen mode causes the menu bar to show up, covering up the top strip of the Xquartz window. The menu bar has the menus for the application that I switched from, but are not clickable. The right hand status bar items (like spotlight), however, are clickable.

The menu bar goes away when I cmd-opt-a exit full screen mode, click the xquartz icon on the dock, and then re-enter full screen mode.

I did not observe this problem in Lion.

Yeah, it's an OS X bug, but I have a workaround that I will be including in 2.7.3 rc1
