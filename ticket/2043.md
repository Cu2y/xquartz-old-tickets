XQuartz only honors keyboard mapping at startup
===============================================


If I start X11 with Dvorak set the only way to switch to Qwerty is to restart X11 after changing the keyboard mapping in the OS X settings. Of course I can't use setxkbmap to move between mappings because that crashes with a divide by zero error.

What's the div-0 bug? Have you filed a report at <http://bugs.freedesktop.org> ?

There's a preference to control this behavior. I'm guessing you just need to check the checkbox ;)

The preference says "use the system keyboard" (I'm translating from the French version)
In fact the bug is that X11 will continue using the keyboard that was active when X11 was launched, and not the current system keyboard. So you must be careful to use the adequate keyboard when launching X11.

If you have that checkbox enabled, then every time you change you OSX keyboard layout, we'll update the keyboard layout in X11. If you have that checkbox disabled, then whatever layout you have at launch will persist.
