application not responding
==========================


After years of being delighted with XQuartz, neither 2.7.5--and now 2.7.6--fail to run normally, in spite of reinstalling. First, as an app under OS-X, XQuartz will start in some fashion, but has no functionality. (I am running OS 10.9.3.) If I run xinit from a terminal window it complains "xinit: XFree86\_VT property unexpectedly has 0 items instead of 1", but an Xquartz, X11, and xterm process is spawned. However, behavior is not normal (e.g., the xterm window is not in a frame, and is fixed at 0,0; any new windows or other X apps--such as xclock-- overlay on each other at 0,0 with no way to access the previous window). Here is the log file after terminating the xinit process:

> If I run xinit from a terminal window

You should never do that unless you really, really, really know what you're doing.

> behavior is not normal (e.g., the xterm window is not in a frame, and is fixed at 0,0; any new windows or other X apps--such as xclock-- overlay on each other at 0,0 with no way to access the previous window)

I think that actually may be normal behavior if you just ran xinit by itself.

What do you mean? What do you expect it to do that it isn't? If you run 'xterm' from Terminal, what happens?

The log file you provided shows a healthy, successful run.
