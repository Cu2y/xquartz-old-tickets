Spontaneous change of space upon new large window
=================================================


I have an image, 2250x2048, which is larger than my screen resolution. When I display it using ImageMagick's display command, Spaces spontaneously moves me to another space. If I'm in Space [\#⁠3](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/3), it moves me to space [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1). If I'm in space [\#⁠1](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1), it moves me to space [\#⁠2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/2).
I am attaching the image. I created it using:
convert -size 2253x2048 xc:white empty-2253x2048.jpg

I have seen the problem where I open an X window on a remote system which causes a switching to a different Space. The most prominent has been launching the find dialog in NEdit. I was able see the effect twice in a row this morning, but then it started working OK.

I can verify that opening the large file empty-2253x2048.jpg with ImageMagick's display command causes a change of Space. I am running with 6 spaces in 2 rows x 3 columns
1 2 3
4 5 6
I started by running the display command in Space 6, which switched me to 5. I did this several times. Then I tried running the display command in a different Space; it switched me to 5. I tried running the display command in Space 5; it switched me to Space 2. Running the command in Space 2 switches me to Space 5. I am now able to verify that if I switch spaces (voluntarily), the Space that I am switched to when running the command is the last one that had an X11 window in it. (I have X windows in 2,4,5,6; I was able to run the command from Space 2 and have it switch me to 4,5,6 depending on where I had switched to 2 from.) So that begged the question: What happens if I only have 1 Space with X windows? The grand answer (I quit and restarted X11): It doesn't switch me!

(I am not able to make the NEdit Find Dialog Space switching as reproducible; perhaps this is a separate issue.)

Hi Jeremy,

> This one plagues me as well. Switching happens about every 5 seconds most of the day. I don't

have any specially large windows, but I run windowmaker, which uses the screen edge a deal...
I'm a few versions back, since I'm using a PPC; v 2.6.0\_rc1.
I haven't found any workaround, & its very annoying. Any suggestions welcome!
Best wishes,

> James.

That's an old version, even for ppc... Leopard/ppc support still exists in 2.6.3. It won't be in 2.7.0, but you should move up to 2.6.3 for sure...

What is happening every 5 seconds? I really need a way to reproduce this. At this rate, I don't think it'll be addressed until we have the big rearchitecture in 3.0

OK, I think now (for me at least) this is some hardware issue. Moving the video lead to the spare
port seemed to cure it, so perhaps a video card or lead problem. Unrelated to Xquartz.
Sorry for the distraction.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
