libGLU on Mavericks
===================


Versions: OS X 10.9, XQuartz 2.7.4, Xcode 5.0.1
Problem: libGLU is build using libstdc++, but the new standard in Mavericks is libc++. Is it possible to have libraries build with libc++ in the new release/patch of XQuartz?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *wontfix*

We need to support Snow Leopard and later. libc++ was first added to OS X in Lion.

libGLU does not expose any C++ APIs, so which C++ runtime we use internally should not have any impact on you.

What is the reason for this request? Please followup on the mailing list.
