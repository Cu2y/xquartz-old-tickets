inaccessible site
=================


For two days, I have been unable to access <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.1.dmg>.

I receive the following errors:

Chrome: "Google Chrome could not connect to static.macosforge.org"

Firefox: "Unable to connect. Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at static.macosforge.org"

Lynx: "Can't access startfile <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.1.dmg>"

Attempts to reach the site with Safari crash the browser!
