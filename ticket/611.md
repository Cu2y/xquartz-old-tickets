Major Freezing/Corruption with XQ 2.7.2 on ML
=============================================


When using OpenGL X forwarded application, major freezing/corruption ensues.

With glxgears there's no corruption but the gears don't rotate.

With VMD it majorly corrupts both my displays.

27" iMac 2011 w/ Dell U2711 secondary
Radeon 6970M GPU
XQuartz 2.7.2
Mountain Lion 10.8 final

I had none of these issues with X11 on Lion.

That is totally not an X11 issue. That looks like a driver issue. Wow, nasty.

Please file a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> including a full system profile and steps to reproduce.
