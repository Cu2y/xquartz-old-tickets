fatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) strikes back with 2.7.8\_rc2
=================================================================================


After upgrading to 2.7.8\_rc2, starting XEmacs gives me:

    > XIO:  fatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.Z9PvbmD6Pt/org.macosforge.xquartz:0.0"
          after 63 requests (63 known processed) with 0 events remaining.

The X server does not crash. Downgrading to rc1 fixes the problem.

Nothing in the X server itself changed.

What are you doing to reproduce this? Is it happening on launch of xemacs?

Where are you getting your build of xemacs?

Yes, it's before the first window is coming up.

> Where are you getting your build of xemacs?

I'm building it myself. I'd be happy to provide more info if you can give me a hint about what you'd need.

I also tried rc3 and the 2.7.8, with identical results - it's completely reproducible.

Again, downgrading to rc1 fixes the problem.

Alot changed between rc1 and rc2. If you could help narrow it down.t that would help. I suggest installing 2.7.8 and making a backup of X11.bin and /opt/X11/lib/\*dylib and then installing 2.7.8\_rc1. Once there, replace X11.bin with the new one, test. If that still works, then we can be fairly confident it's not a server issue. From there, start testing the libraries that xemacs uses: libxcb, libX11, libXi, libXt, etc until you figure out which upgrade introduces the problem.

I just built xemacs from MacPorts, and I cannot reproduce the issue when it runs against XQuartz.app from 2.7.8.

Did that: It's libxcb.

Ok, the difference in libxcb was actually quite small. We updated from libxcb-1.11 to libxcb-1.11.1:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xcb/libxcb/log/?h=7cf5ac145b7b1858ea8d3df178c99c5b00750d37>

There were only three patches to libxcb in that dot release, and none look related to this issue.

Can you try building your own libxcb from source and see if you can narrow down what exactly triggered the regression?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Insufficient Information*

Closing as insufficient information. Please test with 2.7.10\_beta2 when it comes out which will have libxcb-1.12. If you still have issues, open a ticket in bugzilla.
