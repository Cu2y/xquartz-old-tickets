international support missing in X11 2.1.1
==========================================


International language support is missing. Only English.lproj is included in /A/U/X11.app/C/R.

The fix should be easy. As long as there are no changes in gui texts, it should be sufficient to first drop all \*.lproj directories from Leopard's original /u/X/X11.app/C/R into the new location /A/U/X11.app/C/R and then build the .pkg package.
