endless repeated characters sent to xterm after closing Xemacs session
======================================================================


I have Xemacs installed with fink. Whenever I close Xemacs with "control-x control-c", and the focus returns to an xterm window, I get a repeated "ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc..." sequence that continues on the xterm window until I manually go into the xterm and stop it.

In order to do this reproducibly you must switch focus out of XQuartz to any other non-X11 window object. When you return to the Xemacs session and quit, you will get the continuous stream of characters sent to the xterm.

This is 100% repeatable for me.

It has been going on for as long as I can remember using Xquartz.

I can't reproduce this with 2.6.2. Please try a newer build.
