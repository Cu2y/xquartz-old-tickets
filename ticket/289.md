Please provide the output of the NX diagnostic information for that window, xdpyinfo, glxinfo both with the current (broken) and the last working configuration. Also, please report the version number of the last-working version (as stated in X11-&gt;About X11).

Please open a new bug for this surface destroy issue and try 1.4.2-apple46, 1.4.2-apple44, 1.4.2-apple43. Please narrow down the version that introduced your problem with NX. You may want to use this script to help find the version that caused the problem:

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/export/361/trunk/find_version_delta.sh>

download it, set it executable, and run it from within Terminal.app using sudo (sudo ./find\_version\_delta.sh). It will download and install different versions to help you find the version that introduced your problem.

Please keep this bug \*just\* for the colormap issue. Furthermore, please report the requested information here. I do not have access to NX, so there is no way for me to debug this without your feedback. I need to know what visual that window is using when it is not working and when it is working. Pleae provide the necessary information:

glxinfo
xdpyinfo
NX window diagnostic information

for both the working AND broken versions.

The changes between 44 and 45 are very minor. My guess is that the "xp\_destroy\_surface: assertion failed: s != ((void \*)0)" is likely transient. Can you please try 45 and 46 again without closing any windows during the test.

Thanks for the info.

Ok, I have done a bunch of code cleanup and fixed a few bugs in the visuals. Can you please give the 1.5.3-apple13 server a try?

The 1.5.3-apple13 version seams to work again... :-) and the colors seams to be also OK! (see the image)
You still need the "xp\_destroy\_surface" ticket?
