quartz-wm keeps dying in 2.5.0
==============================


quartz-wm keeps dying and I can't figure out why. Firstly, it doesn't open when XQuartz.app opens, so i have to exec quartz-wm & in the first xterm window that pops up. Second, if I close all X11 windows and leave it alone for a few minutes, if I try to open another window I have to start quartz-wm again.

The only thing in the logs doesn't seem to have anything to do with quartz-wm...

Stupid Trac, not letting me change the ticket...obviously this is not a problem in xserver...

Hm. Actually, it might be, because XQuartz.app is the one that actually dies, as I just discovered to my dismay, but it auto-reopened last time, which is why I thought only quartz-wm died. This time I had an app open, and it just died with exit code 1, according to the logs.

The 'Xlib: connection to ":3.0" refused by server' line might be quartz-wm not being able to connect for some reason... Do you have a network home directory? Try deleting your ~/.Xauthority file ...
