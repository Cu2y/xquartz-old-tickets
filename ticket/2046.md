Maximize button does not work with multi screen setup
=====================================================


When using XQuartz on a setup with three screens I am not able to maximize X11 windows on all screens.

-   On smalles screen it works ok
-   On largest screen the window has correct size, but is positioned wrong: About halfway down the screen
-   On the medium size screen the window is too large to fit screen, but positioned correctly at top
