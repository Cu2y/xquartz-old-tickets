path changed twice in .cshrc sourcing
=====================================


Hi,

I run XQuartz 2.7.4 on 10.7.5 with Xcode 4.6.2
It is not recent but I only found out a part of the problem :

modifying the path inside the .cshrc (either directly or sourcing some environment files like ifortvars.csh) will make the added directories appear twice in the new path.

I first found that if I mask these changes inside .cshrc and execute them on the command line, the path will be modified only once.

I now find that if I put all these path modifications and sourcing in a second file (named .nextcshrc) and that I source that second file inside the .cshrc the path will be modified only once too!

That makes no sense to me and would like to know if someone is aware of that problem and if there is a cure (other than deporting all path modifications in a second file)

Thanks
LP

Sorry, the first sentence is not correct.
I wanted to say :

My problem is not recent, it was already there with previous versions of XQuartz and OSX but I only found out today a part of the problem.

XQuartz has nothing to do with csh.
