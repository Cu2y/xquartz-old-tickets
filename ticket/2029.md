X11 Error with Paraview software
================================


Hi,

Since the 2.7.7 update, I encounter a new bug when I use Paraview (3d visualisation software). When I change the color map, Paraview crash and prompt this:
**X Error: GLXBadContextTag 164
**

> Extension: 150 (Uknown extension)
> Minor opcode: 115 (Unknown request)
> Resource id: 0x6004d8**
> **

I didn't find any way to bypass this bug. I just downgrade my version to 2.7.6 and it worked.

Thank you for solving this!

(I'm on OSX 10.9.1)

Also experiencing the same problem, also 'solved' by downgrading to 2.7.6.

I use XQuartz to open ParaView from a headless VirtualBox Scientific Linux. ParaView regularly hangs and the terminal outputs the following many times:

X Error: GLXBadContextTag 164

> Extension: 150 (Uknown extension)
> Minor opcode: 115 (Unknown request)
> Resource id: 0x960005

Easy to trigger the problem in ParaView, e.g. just by trying to edit filter settings.

System details:
Running OS X 10.8.5
VirtualBox 4.3.16
Fully updated Scientific Linux 6.5 with default repos, default VirtualBox install options, e.g. without 3D Acceleration.
ParaView 4.1.0 built using Clang 3.3 against Qt 4.8.5

Should be fixed in 2.7.8. Please confirm.
