Keyboard doesn't work with X11-2.4.0\_rc1
=========================================


I was testing X11-2.4.0\_rc1, and I found a bug related with the input devices, in that case was related with a wacom tablet.
<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/288>
I reported that bug which was fixed, but because of the fix, the keyboard is not working properly.
The only keys working are the Ctrl and shift keys, while pressing any other key, from A to Z, or 0 to 9, X11 just don't do anything.
I tested this with Gimp and with a X11 terminal, X11 behaves like if the keyboard was unplugged except for the shift and ctrl key.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Priority** changed from *minor* to *major*

Please provide the output of 'xmodmap -pk', please try running 'xinput test keyboard' and 'xev' to debug the problem.

I cannot reproduce any bad behavior here. I have tried on both a Macbook and a PowerMac G5.

What are your internationalization settings for your keymap?

Nothing changed between the version shipped in 2.4.0\_rc1 and the binary I gave you that should in any way affect the keyboard.

I'm using a Spanish keyboard, I tried changing to english, but it still doesn't work, I tried typing with the laptop's keyboard but doesn't work either.
I tried opening a terminal and the commands you posted, to do so, I had to write them down using textedit, and copy pasting them using the third mouse button.
'xmodmap -pk' gives me a large list of numbers, and I can't scroll up to see all the output, so I only see a list of numbers from 183 to 255.
'xinput test keyboard' only gets the events from keys Alt (66), shift (64), Control (67) and Caps Lock (65), the rest of keys don't do a thing.
'xev' only gets the Caps Lock key.
Thanks.

Since you can't type in X11, you should run those commands in Terminal.app rather than an xterm.

Additionally, you can save output to a file and attach the file.

$ xmodmap -pk &gt; ~/Desktop/xmodmap\_output.txt

Did you restart X11 after changing to the english keymap?

Yes, I did restart X11 and even reinstall X11.

Sorry about the double attachment, safari hanged up while uploading the attachment.

well your keymap looks right... there is absolutely no reason why you should not be seeing any keypresses from other keys... I'll build a binary with more debugging in it for you to test.

I have built four X11.bin binaries for you to try out. They are located in:
<http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/PR-292/>

Can you please try each and tell me which ones work and which fail (the keyboard test... they should all work for the tablet... just focus on the keyboard).

My reminders:

X11bin-1.bz2 = Tablet Works / Keyboard Works
X11bin-2.bz2 = Tablet Works / Keyboard Works
X11bin-3.bz2 = Tablet Works / Keyboard Works
X11bin-4.bz2 = Tablet Works / Keyboard Works

I also tried the old X11.bin version you posted on the other bug report again, and the keyboard didn't work.
I tested them by opening gimp, trying some shortcuts and then by typing almost every key using the text tool.
I didn't change the keyboard language, so I'm using a spanish keyboard with the spanish language selected.

Thanks.

The only difference between "4" and the old bin was the version number... this is most odd...

I'm going to release 2.4.0-rc2 in the next few days. Please report back on whether or not the keyboard works for you in that version.

I just tried it and it's working pretty good. Keyboard and tablet working perfectly.
I'm gonna be testing this release, I'll report if I find anything more.

And again, thanks a lot!!, really great and fast support.
