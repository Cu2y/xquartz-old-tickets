emulate three button mouse no longer working
============================================


In the X11 that comes with 10.5.4, the"emulate three button mouse" under X11
preferences works fine. It does not seem to work under your XQuartz.

This is on a 12" PowerBook G4

Pardon my ignorance; I'm just a little ol' astronomer. What's an "rc", and
where do I get the latest?
thanks.

Nevermind. I was able to locate X11-2.3.1.rc3.pkg, downloaded it, and it solved the problem.
