Mapping command to control.
===========================


Mapping the command key to control would go a long way to giving a more integrated feel between X clients and native OS X applications.

We are used to Cmd-C for copying text, Cmd-V for pasting it, Cmd-Q for quitting applications, etc. X clients are generally written for PCs that use the Control key as the modifier for these actions. Simply mapping Command to Control would immediately seamlessly fix most of these key binds. Command is currently rarely (dare I say, never?) used by X clients, so this shouldn't be an issue. Cmd-Q should also not quit the XQuartz application but be sent to the focussed X client.

FWIW, I currently use the following to achieve this; but it'd be nice if this were configurable (or even the default) for the benefit of the general populous:

    ! ~/.Xmodmap
    clear Mod2
    clear control
    keycode 63 = Control_L
    keycode 67 = Control_L
    add control = Control_L

-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

No. command in OSX is meta in UNIX. Control in OSX is control in UNIX. The only ambiguity is Alt and Mode\_switch in UNIX both being Option in OSX. And this has a toggle switch in preferences.

cmd-c is the edit menu's copy already.

ctrl-c in your X11 application is your X11 application's fault. ctrl-c does not mean "copy" in UNIX. It means "break". Microsoft changed this, and some developers targeting linux wanting to make it feel more like windows followed suit by breaking linux.

So you're basically saying the responsibility for this is either with the user to manually map his Meta key to Control or with the application to use the Meta key as command modifier (eg. support a relatively Mac-specific key layout).

I agree that this seems like the best approach for a generic X11 server; however, seeing as XQuartz is an X11 server which very specifically targets only OS X as host, perhaps certain assumptions may be made.

Though on the other hand; they would cause perhaps an unacceptable deviation from standard X11.

Actually, the irony of this is that using the Meta key as command modifier is not "a relatively Mac-specific" key layout. Mac's are actually following suit with the rest of UNIX in using Mac OSX's Command like UNIX's Meta.

The applications you are running are incorrectly using control instead of command in order to be more "Windowsy"

> I agree that this seems like the best approach for a generic X11 server; however, seeing as XQuartz is an X11 server which very specifically targets only OS X as host, perhaps certain assumptions may be made.

Yes. That is what has been done:

OSX's Command = X11's Meta

OSX's Control = X11's Control

OSX's Option = X11 Alt or X11 Mode\_switch

> Though on the other hand; they would cause perhaps an unacceptable deviation from standard X11.

For anyone like me which also likes to use the command key on the right as a control equivalent within X11.
I used the tool xev and got the keycode 71 for it.
So create the .Xmodmap like so:
clear Mod2
clear control
keycode 63 = Control\_L
keycode 67 = Control\_L
keycode 71 = Control\_L
add control = Control\_L

Can please someone implement this in the default configuration of XQuartz, not having it is a major productivity issue. It's far from being only a nice-to-have feature.

sorin, just use ~/.Xmodmap (see the comment just before yours) ... that's what it's there for.
