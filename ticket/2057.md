XQuartz does not open/start in Yosemite 10.10 despite log out/log in and/or reboot
==================================================================================


Installed gnubg on previous version of Yosemite, having previously installed XQuartz. Everything worked fine.
After installing latest version of Yosemite gnubg does not start. XQuartz appears not to start.

You'll need to be a bit more verbose than that. XQuartz works fine on Yosemite.

Define "appears not to start"

What happens when you try to start it? Provide logs.

It's not working for me either (see attached crash log). I wonder if I've managed my DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH or something similar?

Ok, changing to behaves correctly based on the provided crash log.

You specifically told the system to use a different (older) libXfont.1.dylib than the one we ship, and the system obliged you and aborted becasue you made a mistake.

Don't set DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH!

If someone tells you it will fix a problem, they are grossly misinformed. Only developers should use that environment variable and only in test situations or very controlled cases.

Users should not set it and expect things to work.

I later discovered that I could start XQuartz from the Dashboard, so apologies... Opening gnubg did previously start XQuartz but does not do so now, hence my confusion. The fault lies in gnubg according to an acknowledged bug report on their site.

is gnubg the party responsible for setting DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH? If not, you still have other problems. If they set that environment variable, please pass the flogging along their way.

I commented out the lines in my .bash\_profile where I appended items to DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (such as paths used by CUDA and MATLAB) and now XQuartz works fine, as expected.
BTW, how do you unsubscribe from email notifications on this system?
