Space key must be pressed twice in Xnest
========================================


I am using X11 with Xnest for connecting to linux machines. To write space I must press space key twice. Same behavior observed for more applications (gnome-terminal, gvim, firefox, ...).
When using xterm from X11 or when running applications via ssh -X, then it is ok.

Is there a reason you're using Xnest and not Xephyr? What happens when you press the key the first time? Can you run xev from within Xnest to debug this?
