menu bar missing
================


I installed Xquartz 2.7.4. After the logout/in, the system menubar was no longer visible, although the space was still occupied (mouse stops when it hits that space).

I trashed the Xquartz app, but I couldn't logout, since the applemenu was not there. I had to reboot from the terminal. After the trash/reboot the menubar was back.

MBP 13" (MacBookPro5,5)
10.8.2

-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

That is a known issue in OS X and has nothing to do with XQuartz. You just got unlucky that it happened to occur to you at the same time you installed XQuartz. If you waited a few more seconds and clicked on the Desktop, the menubar would've appeared.
