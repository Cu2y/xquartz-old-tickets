Taxing Processor under OsX
==========================


I noticed that my system had been sluggish, there were intermittent bluetooth connectivity disruptions (e.g. keyboard, trackpad), and when I glanced at the system temperature the reading was 62C. I systematically forced program shutdowns, and when I ended x11, the temperature dropped to 38C, and system responsiveness and device connection stability recovered within nominal operating parameters.. I only have the latest revision of x11, so I cannot comment on experience with prior versions.

I note that during the time, GIMP had been shut down, so x11 was running as an unused background service.

Some additional information:
