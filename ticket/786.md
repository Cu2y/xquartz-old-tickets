Field data not changing
=======================


Good day,

In entering data into an xQuartz 2.7.4 session, one particular window does not appear to retain changes to it and reverts to previous data on close and save.

Method:
I have a series of existing user profiles in a particular db. In order to add a new profile, I must copy an existing profile, change the machine name to the new add and change the existing user name to the new user.

The first part works and I get a new (duplicated) profile of the initial selection, and it has the new machine name for the profile name. However, the duplicate retains the previous user name despite appearing to have accepted the new user (as the field appears editable).

Under X11 I was able to set a pref (on/off?) that allowed changes to this field thereafter. I think it was "Emulate three button mouse" but I can't be sure since I have been on xQuartz for a long time now and forget the X11 fix. Any idea why this editable field in xQuartz is not retaining changes?

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

Please ask the developer of the application you are using. That is well above the level of X11. We just deliver mouse/keyboard events to the application, and the application is responsible for how it handles that input.
