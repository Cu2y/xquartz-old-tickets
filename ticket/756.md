permission issue on 2.75 beta download
======================================


The latest beta release seems to have a server end permission issue causes the installer to fail when you login direct and try to download says the file is forbidden

2.74 no problems

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5\_rc2.dmg on this server.

Yeah… the odd thing is the permissions are exactly the same for 2.7.5\_rc1 as they are for 2.7.5\_rc2 … something weird is happening … I'll look into it tomorrow.
