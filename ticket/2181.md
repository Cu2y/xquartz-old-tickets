The application X11 could not be opened
=======================================


An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Failed to activate core devices."

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

I installed the most recent version of XQuartz.

I am running on El Capitan (10.11)

Not sure which component is at fault

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Duplicate*

Every time this has been traced down, it has been because of user error (eg: messing with /tmp permissions).

Can you please ask for help on the mailing list?
