Full-screen windows still have title bar
========================================


I'll confess to not knowing very much about what's really going on within XQuartz, so do forgive me if this is something that simply isn't possible.

However, my main use of this is with WINE, and one thing that I notice a lot is that when running applications that have requested full-screen, they still have a title-bar in X11/XQuartz. The result of this is that applications must be opened with reduced vertical height in order to avoid them running off the bottom of the screen.

This also combines somewhat with the requirement to enable "full screen mode" in order to remove the menu bar. Really what is needed is someway to either detect (or provide a mechanism such that X11 can be told) which windows are supposed to be full-screen, so that it can automatically size them accordingly, remove the title-bar, and hide the menu bar when they are in focus, along with the ability to move them to different screens, though the main one is usually going to be fine in most cases. If this simply isn't possible, then a key-combo to full-screen only a single window, and in doing so remove its title-bar would be awesome.

-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*

This was fixed over a year ago in [2.3.2](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.3.2).

I just verified that this works correctly using firefox's fullscreen mode in 2.5.1\_beta3.

And if you want to hide the menu bar as well, you need to run X11 itself in fullscreen mode.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

The games might also be wanting to use RandR to change resolution. If that's the case, then this is really [\#⁠6](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/6)
