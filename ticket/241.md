xquarz uses 100% of CPU when not focused
========================================


I'm using xquartz 2.3.2.1 on osx 10.5.6 on a 2.16 GHz intel core 2 duo. When x11 is running, but is not focused it begins to use 100% of my cpu until re-focused.

Repeatable 100% of the time.

I have the same problem, except that on mine it is using only 1 CPU (out of 2), hence 50%.
Exactly the same symptom - cpu used when switched to another application, ~0% when on X11.app.

What kind of input devices do you guys have on your systems?

Just a laptop with a trackpad, but also when I have a bluetooth mouse paired.

I have a MacBook Pro with regular trackpad (~2 years old). OS 10.5.6.

I am experiencing exactly the same thing. I have a Mac book pro, with leopard version 10.5.6 and the latest version of xquartz. I use a Wacom pen tablet pretty continuously, so I've only just tested it without a pen tablet plugged in. So far, the problem does NOT appear when the pen tablet is not plugged in.

Exactly the same problem here. 100% cpu usage (as reported by top) on one core when X11 is in the background. Makes the fans on my Leopard 10.5.6 Macbook run like crazy.

You should not be seeing it in 2.3.3\_beta1 ... I commented out the code that Chris bisected down to.

Seems fixed to me! Thank you. (2.3.3\_beta1)

I'm experiencing this problem, too. Where can I download 2.3.3 beta1?

Thank you very much.

FWIW, I think everything was ok with 2.3.2.1 until I updated one of my unix packages via fink. Which package? I have no idea. I usually use the update-all command with fink, thus updating as many as 20 packages at a time. I primarily run gnucash and pan, which require the gnome desktop. So, I'm tempted to say that the problem started with one of the gnome components.

I installed 2.3.3 RC5 last night, and as of now, this bug is back. It was gone in RC2.

Well then you are hitting a different bug. Please open a new report and provide a sample of the running process in this configuration and your org.x.X11 preferences. The code that Chris narrowed this down to is commented out, so this is probably something else. What is showing up in Activity Monitor? (answer in your new bug)

-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Chris mentioned that this is indeed the same bug, so the underlying issue is actually something else. I've debugged it and have the fix in git.

this was fixed with:

I wonder what could be causing this now... hmm...
