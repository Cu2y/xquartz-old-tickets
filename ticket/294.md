X11.bin-1.5.3-apple13 --- nonreproducible crash
===============================================


Running on MacPro3,1 under idle-load a nonreproducible crash occurred while closing some random Xaw-application popup-transient window (xless in this case).

I'll attach a crash-report file maybe it contains useful data.

How frequently will this occur? Is xless the only X11 application running?

I'm trying with both xman and xless... and I can't get it to crash... how are you able to trigger it?

Can you attach a coredump?

If you're not generating coredumps in /cores, take these steps (this is how I setup my dev environment, I'm not sure they are all necessary, but it might be helpful):

ulimit -S -c unlimited
sudo mkdir /cores
sudo chmod 1775 /cores
defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType developer

stupid wiki formatting...

    ulimit -S -c unlimited
    sudo mkdir /cores
    sudo chmod 1775 /cores
    defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType developer

Also, could you please use this binary:
<http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/PR-294/X11.bin.bz2>

It has some extra debug spew in it that will goto /var/log/system.log ... please include that info when you get the next crash.

Also, what is the output of 'defaults read org.x.X11'?

No response. Insufficient information, and an old build.
