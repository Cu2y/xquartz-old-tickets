X!! seems to be blocked from downloading.I have mac with latest maverick and when I go to down load it shows the head page and that is all. I have been to system pref. and security and it is set to all downloads, I will be contacting apple to find out why or is there a back door method. Can you give me a heads up on what to do Please.

> Kind regards phil.
