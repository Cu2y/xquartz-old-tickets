Font Library issue since xquartz 2.7.6 update
=============================================


Hi

We use xquartz to run a light board software called DLight. (<http://www.nicole-banana.com>). since the 2.7.6 update, the software as issue with is display. almost all the font were in italic and some feature were completely bugged. Nothing changed with the 2.7.7 release : same problem. The update process was also taking more time than the usual. It froze for a few minutes at the end of the process.

All this could be related to the font library cache. I'll find a fix removing this 4 files from

Macintosh HD/Library/Fonts/

encodings.dir fonts.dir fonts.list fonts.scale

After, the update process was short as usual.

By login in and out, the software run perfectly.

Sorry for my grammar, English is not my mother tongue. Here is a link to the tread from DLight's forum - in french tough - if you're looking for visuals

It looks like your app doesn't like some of the system fonts for some reason. If you can still reproduce the issue with 2.7.8 and can narrow down what font is causing a problem, please reopen. Feel free to also ask for help on the x11-users or xorg mailing lists.
