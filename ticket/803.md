Windows disappear on second monitor with 10.9
=============================================


I just upgraded to OSX 10.9 and I already had XQuartz 2.7.4 installed no the system. When I have a second monitor installed I can't move X11 windows onto the screen. The windows just seem to disappear. As I move a window with my mouse the window slides from the primary monitor but does not show up on the second monitor. If keep moving the window eventually the mouse point will show on the scone monitor. If I stop the move on the scone monitor the window is gone from the displays, but does show up in XQuartz's Window menu. Selecting it does nothing. The window will show up in Mission Control, and I can move it back to my primary monitor and it shows up properly again. I tried restarting XQuartz but this did not help.

As mentioned in the 10+ other duplicate bug reports and the mailing lists, this is not something that can be addressed in Xquartz alone. File a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com>.
