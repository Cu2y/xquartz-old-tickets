Cadence virtuoso (EDA tool: ssh tunneling) display distortion
=============================================================


Hi,

I recently bought a MBP retina labtop for work which has Mountain lion OS X.
The thing is when I tunnel to a local linux server and launch a EDA tool "Cadence" its "library manager" window looks like its displaying every thing on the left half side with a wrong color(red?). I'll attach the screen capture image.

To isolate from any other problems I did checked it doesn't have any problem if I use different computer and also tried running it on a lower version of OS-X which I had been using for years. Even from a Linux ubuntu dosen't
have any problem.

Anyone any idea?

Thank you in advance,
Bryce Lee

I have the same problem when using the "Library Manager" with Cadence Virtuoso using X11 2.7.4\_beta2: The content of the widow is only shown on the left side of the screen, it is purplish, and the fonts have poor fidelity. I am using a MacBook Air with Mountain Lion.

Peter Drembelas

Can you give me more information about the window (xwininfo)?

Can you try changing your "Colors" preference in X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Output to see if that has any effect?

I attached two files "X11\_Cadence\_Library\_Manager.png" where Millions of Colors have been selected. Here it's the "Library Manager" that looks distorted. In the second attachment, "X11\_Cadence\_Library\_Manager\_1000s.png," "Thousands" of colors have been selected and the xterm window now looks distorted.

Yep. I can see this in xterm by changing to thousands in Mountain Lion. Snow Leopard behaves fine.

Please open a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com> as this looks like a regression in CoreGraphics. Please report the radar number here, and I'll track it.

Thanks.

I'm being burned by this as well! I just started using Cadence 6 for my next project at work and pretty much everything needs to be funneled through this (broken) window. This is really harming me at work :-(.

However, is there any way to see the status of the original bug? It would be nice to know if it is something they are working on and some info on the progress or targetted release?
Or if the original bug-reporter can give updates here?

I remember how frustrating it can be on "the outside" to not see the status of radars. I can't comment on when it will be fixed or what the issue is.

I'm also hoping that I might be able to work around the issue in libXplugin in a future release.

I'm also going to file a duplicate bug report with Apple - to increase the awareness and up the priority (by a lot) if possible. However, I feel weird just saying that I'm a fellow victim of bug \# 12248104 even though I'm not really sure specifically what was reported...

I really am screwed by this bug - we design ICs here (including for Apple) and I'm now on a project that puts me in the middle of this issue every day. I feel for the poor souls who have been living with this for a couple months now!!

Also have this same problem. Very bizarre--it makes working on Virtuoso remotely pretty close to unusable, and manifests in multiple submenus.

I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I tried changing the display resolution from the X11 preference as per one suggestion, and under 254 colors, X11 refused to launch with an error. Under Thousands of colors, Virtuoso launched, but the main menu was distorted in the same way. In Millions mode, the behavior was the same as automatic--the main Virtuoso window was fine, as well as the schematic and ADE windows, but many subwindows for library viewers, etc were distorted. I've hosted a screenshot of the behavior here: <https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4983979/virtuoso_x11_error_screenshot.png>

Mac OS X version 10.8.2, X11 version 2.7.4, Cadence IC6.1.5. Everything has been updated to the latest current version as of today, including the Cadence hotfix to IC6.1.5.500.14.

The remote host is a RHEL 6.2 64-bit box, which was a heck of a lot of fun setting up. I have filed a bug report with Apple because this is the reason I use an Apple machine for my work: I can't afford the time spend managing window managers, drivers, library compatibility that inevitably pops up with commercial products like Cadence and just about everything is idiot-proof.

If you can find a solution within XQuartz it would be a \*huge\* help to us Cadence users. People who haven't "upgraded" yet to Mt. Lion can use the old MacOS built-in X server with no problems (my Snow Leopard Mac works fine). It's only we who have "upgraded" that have the problem. I hate losing functionality when I upgrade! I'm not terribly happy with Mountain Lion...

Lion users and Snow Leopard users don't need to use the provided X11.app. They can use XQuartz.app without this issue. This issue only appears on Mountain Lion.

That's not too helpful--it's way too late to roll back the update. Anyway, Apple requested a system profile dump, so at least someone may possibly be looking into it.

I have the same problem with our in house application. The main window for our application looks ok, but any additional dialog window (Open, About, ...) looks distorted. Also, I can confirm that by selecting "Thousands" of colours (in XQuartz Preferences) the Xterm window now looks distorted, as well. Something new regarding that? Maybe a temporary workaround?

and also xman and xlogo are distorted as well, for Thousands of colours.

I fixed my application. It seems that the bug is present only if the application is running in 15/16 bit (Thousands) of colours. So, the solution was to modify the source code to start searching for 24 bit first (before searching for the availability of 15/16 bit mode). I hope this help the others, as well.

Yeah, my workaround was going to be removing the color choice option in preferences and only advertising the 32/24 bit visuals

But even if you have in Preferences only Millions (24/32 bit visuals), the application can search/use 15/16 bit visuals and the bug will still be there, I guess, or not?

The applications are preferring 16bit visuals, so if there are none, they should be falling back on 32bit visuals. If the application doesn't support 32bit visuals, it will fail, and the author should really fix that.

'Who' are you refering to with the application? Should I contact Cadence to let them know their app does not support 32bit visuals correctly or is the application in this case Apple and ssh X11 forwarding?
It used to work pre ML, so I guess it's Apple? Is there a reason why some windows of the application get displayed correctly while some windows don't?
If you want me to test any workaround that you might have, please let me know. We really need this fixed.

Good luck contacting Cadence for a fix :-(. IF they even bother fixing this it'll take them eons, and then our respective CAD departments will also take a while letting the update into our workflow.

There are 2 issues here:

1) Cadence is requesting a 16bit visual.

2) Apple dropped support for 16 bit backing stores in ML

3) X11 advertises 16bit visuals and and use a 16bit backing store to support it.

All three of those lead to the problem. If Apple's CG team decided to support 16 bit backing stores again, it would work. If Cadence requested a 32bit visual instead, it would work. I'm \*hoping\* that Cadence will work if I just disable the 16bit visuals and force it to fall back on 32bit. If it doesn't fall back on 32bit, Cadence will just no longer work on Mountain Lion with that approach (but there are other options).

Classic Apple! They don't see the need for some legacy issue that isn't up to the latest and greatest, so they drop it and let the chips fall as they may. I've said it before, and I'll say it again - I hate \*losing\* functionality when I "upgrade."

How do we put pressure on the Apple CG team to support 16-bit backing stores again so that stuff that used to work, and is still being actively used, and that isn't likely to change in the application, will once again work like it used to before ML?

Can using xnest solve the problem? So using xnest as intermediate remote Xserver that does a translation from 16bit to 32bit?

Did a test running Xephyr on ML display :1 .
In a new terminal I changed the DISPLAY env to localhost:1.0 and started cadence over ssh. Now the library manager looks ok. Its not a clean solution because everything is spawned inside this Xephyr window, but it might be a good starting point for a fix in Xquartz?

Hi,

I have just gone back in with a clean browser session, clocked on the link which took me to the Cadence support login page, I logged in and it took me to he solution page where there is a small patch file to download. If the link does not work for you, try logging onto the support site and searching for

library manager mac

The fix page was top of the list.

I was finally able to view the contents of your link using FireFox (the Cadence site doesn't support Safari). They indicate it's an XQuartz issue, but they do offer a work-around. In my case, I'm at the mercy of our CAD department and, especially because I'm using a Mac, I can't see them implementing this fix. I have pasted the contents of the link below in case others are interested in reading it. I'll be eagerly awaiting the 2.7.5 release of XQuartz...

Problem:

You are running Virtuoso using a Mac in conjunction with XQuartz for displaying the applications. You find that Library Manager does not display properly. The display is compressed (and strangely colored) with menus and their control points misaligned.

Solution:

The library manager works fine with most X-servers being used by our customers today. From investigation, this is not a bug in Virtuoso but rather a bug in the implementation of certain visuals in XQuartz. Other (non-Cadence) applications will also have a problem if using 15-plane visuals. However we are able to provide a workaround to make the display compatible with XQuartz until the problem is properly fixed in XQuartz.

To implement the workaround, you will need write permission to your Cadence installation.
Please download the attached files and run the following commands:

cd `cds_root virtuoso`

tar xvfz &lt;path/to/XQuartz\_patch.tgz&gt;

If you now re-invoke Virtuoso, you should see library manager being displayed properly.
CCR 1075105 has been filed to implement this directly in the Cadence software - to get the library manager and library select (browser) to use the same default visual as the rest of Virtuoso.
The XQuartz bug tracker for this issue can be found here <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/633>

Thanks for the link!
We also patched our cadence software and it now works.

I believe I have worked around this issue in 2.7.5\_rc1. Please test it when it is released.

Fantastic! I can't wait for it to be released, and yet I see that the 2.7.5 milestone has been updated for 4 weeks from now :-(. I don't suppose there's any way at all to roll out an intermediate 2.7.4.1 with this fix - it seems there are enough people harmed by this bug. It would be a great Christmas present for us :-).

Yes please!!! A quicker release for this fix would be fantastic, I need it for school! Or at least make the RC available...

I should have an rc "soon" ... I can't promise much, but hopefully before 2013.

Hi guys, i am having the same issue.
How can i get the rc version?

I go to "Check for Updates" and it says i am up to date with 2.7.4 and this version give me the distorted library manager window with purple color. Nothing about any rc version.

You have to get it from here (under development)
<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki>

I believe the check for update only works for stable releases.

You can use autoupdate from stable to rc, but you need to enable it first. See:
