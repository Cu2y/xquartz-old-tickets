XQuartz crashes and restarts in a loop
======================================


OS 10.7.3
XQuartz 2.7.2

Any application that requires XQuartz to start up automatically (ActiveWorlds and Plastic SCM specifically) will cause this to happen. It will continue until the machine is rebooted.

Here's the error from X11:
An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running"

Here's what I dug out of the console:

This is bizarre:

    mv: command not found

Why would you not have 'mv' in your path? The 'mv' is supposed to "fix" the issue that you are facing, but it's not working properly. Try debugging the /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/privileged\_startx.d/10-tmpdirs script. Add in some things like:

    echo $PATH
    which mv

etc to figure out what is going wrong.

I'm not sure why mv wouldn't be found. I execute commands like that all the time from my terminal. It makes me wonder if there's a .profile or something that works specifically with apps launched from the dock and somehow it's whacked on my machine.

It turns out which isn't on the path either. I also caught this in the logs:

> /opt/X11/bin/font\_cache: line 272: rm: command not found

I'll have to do some research to ensure my machine is in a more pristine state. When I was debugging the script I happened to run it from my terminal (which has a full path configured) and it cleared up the crash problem like you said it would, so I'll need to find another way to produce the error again. Until then at least we have a workaround - just run the /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/privileged\_startx.d/10-tmpdirs script as root. Thanks for the help!

To reproduce the error, do this as your normal user account:

    rm -rf /tmp/.X11-unix
    mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix

That should make that directory with incorrect permissions (and blow away whatever else was there beforehand).
