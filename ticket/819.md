Keyboard messed up Mac OS X 10.8
================================


Hi! I have a Mac Book Pro with Mountain Lion. I am trying to connect to an Ubuntu 12.04 VM with x2go and the keyboard is messed up. For example, typing d prints 1 on the screen, f prints 2, g prints 4 etc. I have tried to solve this problem for too long but i can't find anything. I thank you in advance.

My guess is you changed the keymap when you connected. Make sure you disable keymap changes.

I updated from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5, and all I did was run the installer. I can't think of anything I did that changed the keyboard map.
I'm having this same problem. How to "disable keymap changes"?
TIA
