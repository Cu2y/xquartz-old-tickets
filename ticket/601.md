Wine – Flickering in Full Screen Mode
=====================================


I run Windows applications on my Mac with [Wineskin](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/) (it is basically Wine and XQuartz). The problem is that when a Windows program goes full screen, the screen begins to flicker. You can see what I'm talking about [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9DQ7fg0mXI/). This only happens if DirectDraw Renderer in Wine is set to OpenGL, with the GDI setting there's no flickering (but not every application works with this option). Running applications in windowed mode causes no flickering whatsoever, however then it feels more like using an iPad and not Mac.

Now, I wonder whether the issue could be related to XQuartz rather than Wine. Can you take a closer look at this, please?

Lion 10.7.4, ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256 MB, Wineskin 2.5.5

There is a bug report on Wine's Bugzilla: <http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29261>

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

I just played the first level of Quake 2 in wine 1.5.8 with no flicker. Yes, the games are obviously different, but there's nothing for me to go on, and wine is not something I directly support. Please followup with the wine bug. If they determine that it is somehow XQaurtz related, I'll look at their evidence, but it seems wine related considering that the flicker seems to be caused by the wine error message overlay...

Oh, ok. That's not an overlay but rather stale video memory... odd... perhaps a double-buffering issue...
