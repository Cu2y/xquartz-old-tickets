XQuartz URL reference leads to bogus / error / new ticket web page
==================================================================


The web site for GIMP provides a link (<http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/>) to download and install XQuartz prior to installing GIMP; however the link leads to an errant web page. Only after registering with the MacOSforge web site does the XQuartz web page appear with its information.

Not very good. If you want to force people to register before allowing the download, that's okay, but the web page needs to make that clear.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.3*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

That's a valid link on their site... you don't need to register to view this site's contents.
