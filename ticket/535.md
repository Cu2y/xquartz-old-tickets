Default background all black.
=============================


I use XQuartz in full screen mode. After upgrading from 2.6.3 to 2.7.0 (and 2.7.1rc1) the default background in full screen mode has changed from the expected and comfortable "familiar grey mesh" to solid black. "xsetroot -def" does no good ("resets" to black), so it seems as the problem lies in the server.

It's probably a minor mistake somewhere, so please fix before releasing 2.7.1.

Tested under 10.6.7 on MacBook Pro 13" from mid-2010, and under 10.6.8 on iMac 27" from early 2011 with the same result.

Best regards,

This was an X.org decision which we inherited.
