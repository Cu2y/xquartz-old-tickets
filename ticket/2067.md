xvfb-run no longer starts Xquartz
=================================


The fink developers believe that in the past the use of a xvfb-run script would trigger Xquartz to launch but this no longer appears to work in Xquartz 2.7.7 and 2.7.8 beta1. The attached xvfb-run script can be executed as ...

xvfb-run xcalc

and should trigger the Xquartz application to launch automatically.

So what does happen?

> My only guess is that Xvfb now demands the presence of files in /tmp which aren't there after a reboot. Note that if you launch the Xquartz application, quit it and then execute the test of "Xvfb :10", you get...

Actually this behavior seems to have been pre-existing and the fink developers never noticed it before. However, it might be considered as an enhancement request to Xvfb so that non-root users who invoke Xvfb can trigger the launching of Xquartz such that the required directories in /tmp get created first.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

Or you could just use startx which will do it for you, or you can update the xvfb-run script to trigger /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/privileged\_startx
