2.3.1 RC1 fails to detect keymap
================================


As requested on the mailing list, here is a report of 2.3.1 RC1 failing to detect my system key mapping. I use a customised British key mapping.

{{{19/08/2008 10:41:20 org.x.startx\[612\] X11.app: Error detected in determining keyboard layout. Please report this error at <http://xquartz.macosforge.org>
19/08/2008 10:41:20 org.x.startx\[612\] X11.app: Debug Info: keyboard\_type=32, currentKeyLayoutRef=0x5653c0, currentKeyLayoutDataRef=0x0, chr\_data=0x0
19/08/2008 10:41:20 org.x.startx\[612\] X11.app: Debug Info: kKLuchrData fallback failed, trying kKLKCHRData.
19/08/2008 10:41:20 org.x.startx\[612\] X11.app: Fallback succeeded, but this is still a bug. Please report the above information.}}}

The mapping file is attached. It is installed in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts".

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.3.0 (xserver-1.4)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.1*

Where did you get your customized keyboard layout? You should send them this information:

"""
Any KCHR can be converted to an XML-style keyboard layout using the tools here:

<http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/download/>

The tool isn't listed on the download page, but it's included in the install. It's called klkchrtoxml.

We strongly recommend that people using third-party keyboard layouts that are not already in XML format convert them.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *wontfix*

Closing, since this is a problem in a 3rd party keyboard layout.
