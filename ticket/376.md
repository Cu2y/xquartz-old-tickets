100% cpu usage when X11 is in background
========================================


Switching to a different space from X11 seems to make this happen though this is not reproducible reliably. top or activity monitor shows x11 is hogging 100% of the cpu. The problem goes away when I switch back to X11. But this has resulted in battery being run down far too many times.

I am running 2.5.0 on Mac OS X 10.6.3 but this is an old problem that seems to have not been fixed for ages. I have the same problem with previous versions of Xquartz and Mac O X and I am really tired of it!

This is on a MBP, with no extra IO devices. Windows are grouped in six spaces. I am attaching a process sample when X11 was in this state.

What X11 clients do you have running? Does this happen on a fresh user?

Only Xterm. By "fresh user" do you mean on a fresh start? I think this happened at least once.

if it matters, I do have "focus follows mouse" turned on.

I did install (or reinstall, can't remember) 2.5.0 after upgading to 10.6.3.

Thanks for a quick response!

I mean a fresh user account. Create a new account and login as that user.

Do you have a ~/.xinitrc ?
Do you have a ~/.xinitrc.d ?

Does it go away with "focus follows mouse" turned off?

Bugs [\#⁠132](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/132) and [\#⁠241](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/241) dealt with this in the past, but those are fixed.

No idea. I will give it a try. Perhaps you can replicate this symptom with it turn \*on\*?

It is not deterministic or else I would given you an exact sequence to replicate! You may have to leave it on for a while.

What about spaces? Does spaces have any effect on it?

Let me know if there is anything else I can check out for you or if you want me to run a version under gdb etc.

seems to have no effect -- focus still follows mouse. I quit and restarted and

reports NO

com.apple.terminal is Terminal.app ... I don't think it knows about FFM. Just turn it on and off using X11 preferences.

I knew this but forgot! Thanks!

Without FFM it still gets in the same 100% cpu use state.

Looking at the prev fix, can mieqEnqueue() ever \*not\* enqueue an event?

Yeah, I'll look into that, but it shouldn't ever not enqueue the event... I'm wondering if it's possible that it enqueues it in a way that the pipe won't empty... hmm...

Attaching dtruss(1) to the running X11.bin reveals an interesting pattern. Quickly switching to and away from the X11 space shows, among other things, there are three back to back 1 byte writes of '\\0'. I am guessing these must be from DarwinPokeEQ(). Usually followed by select(), itimer() and three reads of 1 byte each. Occasionally these select and reads overlap with writes. But once in a while there are no reads or select following the 3 writes! And then it seems read() is not triggered until we switch back to the X11 space. After a few more space flips the paterns reverts to writes followed by reads.... But all this while X11 behaves normally. It hasn't gone back to busy state since I've attached dtruss!

Not sure if any of this is helpful! But I am wondering if there is a race condition of some sort given the unpredictability (though I seem to be able to trigger this bug several times a day). I will reattach dtruss the next time it gets in this state.

Yeah, those writes are surely coming from DarwinPokeEQ().

DarwinPokeEQ() is there to essentially wakeup Dispatch() on the DDX thread. On other DDXs, this is ueually done with the signal handler due to an I/O. XQuartz is inherently a bit different, so we came up with this approach at XDC in 2007 and haven't had problems since fixing bug [\#⁠241](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/241) (which Chris says is still fixed).

When you have the three unrread writes and switch back to XQuartz.app, is there a fourth write of \\0 before the reads? If so, that might indicate that the events are getting dropped. If not, that means the events are likely "stuck" and the thread isn't processing them correctly... the odd thing is that in your sample, the DDX thread (dix\_main) is active for part of the time...

I'm a bit befuddled. Pleae try to find a way for me to reproduce this. Can you please remove (and backup) your ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist and try with a fresh configuration.

I didn't see a 4th write.

Aha, just now it got into this state when I quickly flipped to x11 space and back. I attached dtruss to it and I see a continuous stream of select/setitimer.

I can try removing the plist but what do you hope to learn? It looks normal enough in the property list editor. It may be better to attach gdb when the bug manifests itself.

To reproduce the symptom you can try to replicate my setup: create 6 spaces, assigning X11 to space1, tile it with three xterms side by side (two 80x65, one 78x65, enable FFM, and then flip back and forth between this space and other spaces as quickly as possible. On another space I leave the activity monitor window open.

Same problem. This is what I did:
Created a new account -- only specified a name. Standard account. Logged out from mine. Logged in as this new user. Started up xquartz. Created 3 windows side by side (65x80 65x80 65x78). Started the activity monitor. Created 6 spaces. Enabled display of space icon in the menu bar. Moved the activity monitor window to space 4. Quickly swicheed back and forth between space 1 and 4 until activity monitor show that x11 was using up 100% cpu. Logged out. No other program was started (except preferences for spaces).

If you can't replicate the bug,

Just curious... can you try 2.6.0\_beta2 and disable the clipboard from X11 preferences:

<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.6.0_beta2.dmg>

That will at-least rule out anything in libX11 / client-side craziness...

That version also has a rework of the event queue which is where I suspect the problem is. Sorry I haven't gotten you a debug build to try with yet. I'm finally able to spend some time on X11 and I'd like to get this addressed =).

I disabled both clipboard related settings with no change. I can still get it to 100% usage. I then tried disabling all syncing on pasteboard. Same result.

What do I need to download and how do I create a debug build? Specific instructions will help. I think I have to debug this since this seems something peculiar to my system. Thanks!

<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/DeveloperInfo> is a good place to start if you can handle it on your own.

I'm attaching my compile script which should help too...

Closing due to lack of response, and inability to reproduce on my system.
