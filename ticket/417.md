Incrementing DISPLAY value after crash
======================================


> MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.3

> After an Xquartz crash, restarting xquartz from the dock is ok, but to access the display the DISPLAY variable has to be incremented, e.g., after first crash, "setenv DISPLAY :1", after next crash, "setenv DISPLAY :2"

> Cycle begins again after re-boot (:0, :1, :2 ...)

> Discovered this but looking in the systems log for xquartz startup, example attached.

yeah, if it doesn't cleanup the sockets, it assumes they're in use... this is by design...

Thanks. The problem is then not this feature but that some install script added "setenv DISPLAY :0" to my .tcshrc file. Deleted this, behavior is now better.
