X11 loses focus momentarily every 10 seconds on MacBook Pro
===========================================================


I am experiencing an X11 problem on my new MacBook Pro that does not happen on my Mac Pro tower or on several iMacs I maintain. Every 10 seconds or so the focus is lost in any X11 window for about 2-3 seconds. The spinning ball appears and then focus returns. During this time X11 remains the application. For instance, if I am typing in an xterm window, about every 10 seconds the cursor turns from black to an outline, then the ball appears, and then things return to normal. The only other applications I am usually running are mail, Safari, and ical, and I see the same problem with all of these down. I'm using the latest Leopard (10.5.8). My MacBook Pro is a 2.53 GHz with 8GB ram and a 240 GB SSD. I don't see this behavior in non-X11 applications (i.e., terminal). I do not have remote management turned on. This problem was with the "standard" X11 that came with the machine, but downloading your 2.4.0 the problem remained. I went so far as to try reinstalling OSX from the system disk but it had no effect on the problem. Thanks.

Let me add one further fact. If I immediately click in the window when focus is lost, I immediately regain focus and can continue typing---and the spinning ball never appears. This is why I'm describing this as a "loss of focus". So, in an xterm window what I've been doing is type-type-type-(lose focus)-click!-type-type-type. But, if I don't click right away the focus returns
about 2-3 seconds later, after the ball has spun.

this is a known bug with the mbp and is not x11 related at all... update your hd firmware via software update

Well, if you say so. However, I **only** see this behavior with X11 applications, and I've kept up with the software updates. Any other suggestions would be appreciated.
