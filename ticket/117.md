X11 does not follow new 10.5.3 Spaces behaviour
===============================================


I've found a spaces issue with 2.3.0-rc2 under 10.5.3, relating to a new feature in the 10.5.3 version of Spaces. The Spaces preference now contains a new option, the rather wordy: "When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application".

When this is unchecked, clicking on the Dock icon or using command-tab to select it will not automatically switch the space to the application, so for example you can open a Safari window on another Space by clicking on the Dock icon then pressing command-N. Double clicking on the Dock icon will switch to the Space where the active window is.

This is basically the implementation of spaces auto switching that I had been hoping for since Leopard was released, so I'm very happy.

However - it doesn't work with X11. Clicking the Dock icon once, or selecting X11 app with cmd-tab still autoswitches to the space where X11 was activated like the old pre-10.5.3 Spaces behaviour, so in essence X11 ignores the Spaces preference setting.
