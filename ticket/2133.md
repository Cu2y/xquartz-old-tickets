Xquart cannot work by default, but enter Xquartz in terminate works well.
=========================================================================


Hi all,

> There is a damage bug in using Xquartz, I installed Xquartz in OSX 10.10.2(may be 10.10.1), It works well. But after one day, I update the operation system to 10.10.3. It cannot work. When I enter xclock in terminate, the X11 app opened but with nothing else.
> It's not the worst thing. When I close the X11, it reopened after while. It seems a process named xinit opened it automatelly. I have to log out to close the app.
> And when I enter "Xquartz" in terminate , the X11 app opened successfully, and I can open the xterm, and enter xclock in it, The clock appears. And when I close the app opened in that way, it won't reopen.
> Please help me to make the app work normally.
