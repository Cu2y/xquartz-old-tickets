Problem after upgrade from Mavericks to Yosemite
================================================


XQuartz v2.7.6 no longer launches Wireshark or my Epsilon programmer's editor. Downloading v2.7.7 was unsuccessful, it either failed to install properly (when it did download completely), or did not download completely after several further attempts. Creating a symlink from /usr/X11 to /opt/X11 got Wireshark running, but it did not recognise any interfaces for capture (this may be due to permissions changes in Yosemite that I'm not aware of, Wireshark is fussy that way). Epsilon is trying to load /usr/X11R6/libX11.6.dylib, which is apparently not there any more (looks like it never was, it's not in my Time Machine backups anywhere). Should I just try re-installing Wireshark and Epsilon or is there something else to try first? I just tried updating to v2.7.7 now and the download completed but it's been "Extracting update..." for 35 minutes now, so obviously something is haywire. All this was working ok in Mavericks.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

I'm guessing the update deleted the /usr/X11R6 symlink as well. Please just re-install.

The removal of the symlinks is a bug in the Yosemite installer, not in XQuartz. I filed a Radar at rdar://20943483; I'll update it to mention the /usr/X11R6 symlink as well.

The inability to recognize interfaces is probably due to Yosemite dropping support for StartupItems, so that the "set permissions on the BPF devices" StartupItem doesn't run, and you thus need root permission to capture traffic (\*DO NOT RUN WIRESHARK AS ROOT!\*); recent versions of Wireshark switched to using a LaunchDaemon instead, and should fix that problem. In any case, it's unrelated to XQuartz.
