Focus-Follows-Mouse: Cmd-q gets through
=======================================


    *** Original report on x11-users:

    I run MacOSX 10.5.2 and X11 2.1.3.  Instead of Quartz I use Ion as my
    X11 window manager (see http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/).
    When I switch from X11 where I have a xterm open to another application
    and hit Cmd-q to quit this Application, focus jumps back to X11 (as it
    should) and the character 'q' shows up in my xterm (as it should not).
    So obviously X11 receives the q part of Cmd-q as a key event.

    BTW, this happens for me with every X application that has the focus
    under X11, not only with xterm.


    *** After a couple of posts Jeremy replied to a post of Tom:

    Ok, I can reproduce it now... Step 6 was what I was missing.  It's
    definitely ffm related (which means it's a bit low on the priority
    list, sorry).

    Please open a bug in our trac and an apple radar.

I spent a little bit of time on this and realized that it seems to be specific to command-Q; if you press some other command key, or Q without command, it doesn't get through to the X11 window underneath. This makes it smell like a race condition associated with application quit. (Testing with 2.2.1 now).

I don't get this with the current version... Can you try 2.3.2\_beta2 when I release it in the next couple days...

This might've been fixed when I cleaned up the input handling.

Please test with 2.3.2\_beta2. I can't reproduce it using that release. Reopen if it's still an issue.

Nope, sorry, it's not fixed in the least. I'm not sure why you can't reproduce it.

1.  Open an X11 xterm

<!-- -->

1.  Start iCal

<!-- -->

1.  If necessary, position iCal window to partially overlap xterm

<!-- -->

1.  Make sure x11 thinks the xterm window is active --- if needed, move mouse over xterm then over iCal

<!-- -->

1.  command-Q

<!-- -->

1.  Note appearance of characters in xterm window

Some X11 applications see the event as a plain Q and some don't; since 2.3.1 xterm tends to print n-tilde not q.
But they shouldn't be getting any event at all.

I agree that they shouldn't be getting any event at all... I'm just wondering if it's an NSApplication bug rather than an X11 bug.

Can you try this with 'xinput test \#' when \# is the input id for the keyboard when you run 'xinput list' while running this test and report what is sent with this "q"?

Further, you might want to try with xev as the window under the cursor and send that info as well.

Thanks

Hm, I don't quite understand about xinput, but here is a report about xev.

1.  Start x11 by clicking on its dock icon.

<!-- -->

1.  In the resulting xterm window, invoke /usr/x11/bin/xev

<!-- -->

1.  Drag xev's window to midscreen

<!-- -->

1.  Start iCal by clicking on its dock icon. At this point you should have iCal partially overlapping xev.

<!-- -->

1.  Move mouse over xev window to iCal's window. (This produces some events in xev, which is pretty durn

dubious in itself because x11 does not have focus?)

1.  command-Q

What I see in xev is:

MotionNotify event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191587634, (94,47), root:(711,461),
> state 0x0, is\_hint 0, same\_screen YES

\[ that's the last of the dubious events from step 5 \]

KeyPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191594443, (94,47), root:(711,461),
> state 0x0, keycode 63 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta\_L), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
> XFilterEvent returns: False

KeyPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191594443, (94,47), root:(711,461),
> state 0x10, keycode 20 (keysym 0x71, q), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (71) "q"
> XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (71) "q"
> XFilterEvent returns: False

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191594443, (94,47), root:(711,461),
> state 0x10, keycode 20 (keysym 0x71, q), same\_screen YES,
> XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (71) "q"
> XFilterEvent returns: False

\[ the above happen in response to command-down then Q-down, \*before releasing keys\* \]

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191601960, (94,47), root:(711,461),

KeyPress event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

> root 0x27f, subw 0x0, time 1191604121, (94,47), root:(711,461),
> state 0x0, keycode 57 (keysym 0x20, space), same\_screen YES,

KeyRelease event, serial 29, synthetic NO, window 0xa00001,

\[ the above happen on releasing the command key \]

Even worse than that: if you are slow about releasing the Q key, X11 itself offers to quit.
But at least it doesn't just do so ...

Ok, I think I understand this now...

It's the \_release\_ NSEvent that is getting seen by X11.app, and this is being translated into a press/release by the server... hmm...
