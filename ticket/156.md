PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me you were using the debug version of the server to catch this crash:

If so, please tell me the output to system.log when this occured and give me the last 50 or so lines from ~/x11-debug.txt

If not, please install <http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/testing/SwitchCoreKeyboard-NewCurrentScreen/X11.bz2>
and see this post for more information on how to use it:

<http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/xquartz-dev/2008-August/000971.html>

Are you able to reliably reproduce it?

Does it occur on startup or while X11 has been running for a while?

Unfortunately not, this is the first crash I've had with X in a long time. I'll install the debug version and try to reproduce it.

X wasn't running when I started Gimp, I opened an image and shortly after X crashed.

The pertinent debug spew is also provided by 2.3.1\_rc2 and later... I have a feeling the rarity of this crash is going to make it problematic to track down.

I've installed 2.3.1\_rc2, and created the ~/x11-debug.txt file, but have been unable to reproduce the crash... I'll keep trying...
