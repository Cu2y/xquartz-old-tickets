gnome-settings-daemon messes up keyboard entry
==============================================


When you run gnome-settings-daemon (remotely on Ubuntu but using your Mac to display) all further text entry on the Mac's xserver produces the wrong output. This is the case until you restart X11.

Example key presses and output (the number keys are from the number row, the number pad produces different output):

    Key press | output
    __________________

    1             | e
    2             | r
    3             | t
    4             | y
    5             | i
    q             | -
    w             | =
    e             | backspace
    z             | 5
    x             | 6
    c             | 7
    v             | 8

This behaviour exists in windows unrelated to the ubuntu connection and persists after I have ended the ubuntu connection.

Example session:

    Chris-iMac:~ chris$ '''ssh -Y''' chris-laptop.local

This isn't a bug in XQuartz. Your gnome keyboard settings are wrong.

In other words, you're running an application which is telling the X server what the layout should be, and we're accepting those changes. The fact is that Gnome is giving the server incorrect data.

Try running gnome-keyboard-manager (or something like that) and changing gnome to disable XKB support...

Just in case someone finds this on Google, you need to do this before starting gnome-settings-daemon:

    export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1

Better yet, don't use gnome-settings-daemon for remote connections.
