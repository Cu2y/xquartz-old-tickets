PGPLOT X11 window not redrawing with X11 2.3.1
==============================================


PGPLOT, a library for plotting utilized frequently by astronomers, no longer works correctly when using its X11 plotting device with X11 2.3.1. Initial plotting works, however modifications made to the plot which would previously change the plot in real time in the X11 window, no longer register and the X11 window remains static with its original contents. The only way to update the window is to change to a different plot device, close the X11 window and its server window, and then restart the X11 window. This must repeated to show any changes.

The window indeed does not get redrawn anymore since version 2.3.1, \*unless\* the PGPLOT window has focus. This might shed some light on what's going on (for most cases it's not a solution).

This bug was not present in or before 2.3.1rc5. Presumably linked to the changes in visuals made in rc6 and later.

Do you know what visual pgplot is using?

According to xwininfo: 8-bit Pseudocolor.

Does this problem occur if you enable 256 color mode in X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Output?

It works if I use 256 color mode.

I've found that starting the PGPLOT server with "pgxwin\_server -win\_visual truecolor" works in my case. Selecting 256 color mode in X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Output does not work, unless perhaps I restart X11 completely instead of just the pgxwin server (which I haven't tried).

Yes, if you change the color mode, you need to restart X11.
