Please refer to ticket \#341 that was inappropriately closed
============================================================


I had already rebuilt fink before I submitted the ticket, and XQuartz also admits that X11 2.4.0 is not built for Snow Leopard, and that 2.4.1 will be the first version that includes a SL build. However, there's no indication when 2.4.1 will come out, and in the meantime so many X11 functions are broken. Please help. Thanks.

2.4.1 is not likely to be released. 2.5.0 is likely the next version.

I already answered the rest of your questions in the original bug report. Please join the mailing list if you need further support.

If you really did rebuild fink after updating to SnowLeopard, you would not be having the reported problem.
