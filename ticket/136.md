Xquartz hangs
=============


If Xquartz is launched from the terminal and then killed (ctrl + z), and X11 is then launched, X11 doesn't finish loading and hangs. After force-quitting it, and relaunching it works fine.

ctr-z does not kill. It suspends.

Xquartz is the X11 server, so I don't know what you mean here.

Explain how "Xquartz is launched from the terminal". Do you run startx, /usr/X11/bin/Xquartz?

Explain how "X11 is then launched". How are you doing this differently than in the step above.

As I see it now, X11 doesn't finish loading and hangs because, well... you suspended it by doing ctr-z.

If that is not the case, please answer the above questions and reopen with more information (including the version of X11 you are running)
