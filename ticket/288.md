Brush behaviour problem with latest versions
============================================


Hi there,
I have problems since version X11-2.3.2\_beta1 with the brush tool when drawing with a digital tablet (wacom intuos 3), macbook and 10.5.7.
X11-2.3.2\_beta1 works great, the brush tool runs smoothly, but with the newest versions, the brush tool "shakes" randomly.
Please, take a look at the attached jpeg file so you can see what I mean.
Thanks.

Can you please tell me the xorg-server versions of the last-working and first-broken release. These versions are printed in X11-&gt;About X11 and will look something like "1.4.2-apple10"

Thanks.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Version** set to *2.3.2 (xserver-1.4)*

BTW, the old packages are in the "archive" directory. eg:

<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/archive/X11-2.3.2_beta1.pkg>
<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/archive/X11-2.3.2_beta2.pkg>

Also, would you mind trying this binary:
<http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/PR-288/X11.bin.bz2>

Install 2.4.0\_rc1, then replace /A/U/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin with that one (after decompressing)

Xquartz 2.3.2 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple18), this is the last version that works ok, the newer ones had the 100% CPU bug and then the "shaky" bug.

Sorry but I can't uncompress X11.bin.bz2, doubleclicking it just gives me a X11.bin wich I can't uncompress.

Arrg, sorry, my bad, I should read better.

I downloaded the 2.4.0\_rc1 and replaced the .bin, and now X11 just won't open, running it via terminal gives this message:

-: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin: Permission denied
-: line 0: exec: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin: cannot execute: Unknown error: 0

Thanks

You probably mucked up the permissions. Chances are your new X11.bin isn't executable now. Do:

    chmod 755 /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

Additionally, I think you misread my earlier post. Thank you for reporting that xorg-server 1.4.2-apple18 works. Please tell me the first version number that DOESN'T WORK as well.

I made a script that will help you figure out the version change that caused the problem. If the X11.bin above still fails, please use this script to find the version that introduced this problem. If the above mentioned version fixed it for you, there is no need to take these steps.

Open up Terminal.app (this is necessary since you will be restarting X11 to try new versions). In Terminal.app, execute the following:

    cd /tmp
    curl -LO http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/find_version_delta.sh
    chmod 755 find_version_delta.sh
    sudo ./find_version_delta.sh

This will start downloading and installing various versions of X11 between 1.4.2-apple18 and 1.4.2-apple45 bisecting down to the version that causes your problem. Make sure you answer the "Does it work" question with respect to \*YOUR\* issue (eg, if a version produces a purple image that should be orange, but your pen still writes smoothly, answer 'y').

Ok, thanks.
I just tried the X11-2.4.0\_rc1 with your x11.bin and the "shaky" bug still persists, just not as much as the original version.

And the results for your script:

Trying 1.4.2-apple31 Is this version working (y/n)? y
Trying 1.4.2-apple38 Is this version working (y/n)? n
Trying 1.4.2-apple34 Is this version working (y/n)? y
Trying 1.4.2-apple36 Is this version working (y/n)? y
Trying 1.4.2-apple37 Is this version working (y/n)? y

1.4.2-apple37 was the last to work
1.4.2-apple38 was the first to break

Well then that means this patch caused your problems. I'm going to need to think about this a bit more, but for now I atleast know what change caused it:

Could you give this a try:

<http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/PR-288/X11.bin-2.bz2>

It's a fairly dirty hack on top of an already dirty hack, but I suspect it will work for you. Please let me know.

It works like a charm, but now the keyboard doesn't work except for the ctrl and shift keys.

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Please open a new bug and explain what you mean by "the keyboard doesn't work"

Sorry, I installed X11-2.4.0\_rc1 then I ran Gimp, draw a little, then I saw the bug with the brush tool, then closed gimp and X11, changed X11.bin with the las version you provided and reopen gimp+x11 again. I draw a little bit more again, and the brush bug was gone, so Gimp worked fine, but when I tried to use the keyboard for tool switching, or to write a text with the text tool or.. whatever, any key I pressed didn't do a thing, only the control key worked and the shift key, because when using the brush tool I saw the eyedropper tool when pressing control, I could use the straight line mode of the brush tool etc...

So it looks like the change you did to x11.bin, solved the brush tool bug but broke the keyboard input in some way.

Sorry about all these troubles, and thanks again for your support.

please open a NEW bug report for the keyboard issue. Please try running 'xev' and 'xinput test keyboard' to debug further. Also include the output of 'xmodmap -pk' ... but do so in a new report.
