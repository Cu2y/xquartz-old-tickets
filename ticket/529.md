X11 losing focus on Lion with iCloud
====================================


I believe this losing focus issue is years old now and since ever it is driving me nuts. With the release of Lion in combination with Address Book syncing over iCloud it has gotten even worse. About every minute, this log is written to the syslog:

`com.apple.syncservices.SyncServer: 2011-11-03 15:45:15.915 AddressBookSync[91352:707] In standby, skipping sync`

And when that happens, my X11 apps lose focus and do not get it back. Disabling the syncing solves the problem. Well, not entirely because there are other processes that also make X11 apps lose focus. Sometimes they get the focus back but many times you have to activate your app again to get it back.

I have seen this behaviour on all my Mac OS machines (around 4) and I would love to see this problem fixed.

I'd love to help solving this problem so please please contact me if I can.

Kind regards,

Danny Bloemendaal.

com.apple.syncservices.SyncServer is not iCloud syncing. That is the old MobileMe syncing.

Please elaborate on what you mean by "Disabling the syncing solves the problem" ... do you mean disabling iCloud syncing?

Ok, perhaps. But when I disable Address Book in iCloud prefs this per-minute log entry disappears and X11 isn't losing focus every minute anymore (still very so often but not every minute).

I already suspected that this losing focus problem is somehow related to all kinds of syncing processes in the background.

Yeah, I've confirmed that AddressBookSync is not part of iCloud. I'm confused why toggling iCloud on and off would cause this. I wonder if something else is trying to use Address Book Sync Services. Do you sync your AB with anything else like Gmail, Yahoo, or any other 3rd party sync service? I wonder if there's a conflict with it and iCloud for some reason.
