XQuartz crashes when sharing OpenGL display lists
=================================================


UCSF Chimera, <http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/>, gets 2.3.2 beta3 to crash when trying to share display lists. In this particular case, it was because chimera was trying to change to a visual with alpha bitplanes and preserve all of the existing display lists. To reproduce this bug, you need to first workaround the glXChooseFBConfig bug by starting chimera with the --debug-opengl command line option and unchecking the FBConfig box.

FYI, 2.3.2\_rc1 is better, I can switch to a visual with alpha bitplanes and back. But I am still unable to switch in and out of stereo reliably. I always see "error: invalid share context" and frequently get a BadAlloc error. That error message is not part of chimera.

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?

Stereo visuals still cannot share display lists with non-stereo visuals which is contrary normal X server behavior (the GLX specification says that contexts can share display lists as long as they share the same address space and are on the same screen). This may be related to ticket [\#⁠122](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/122).

Are you using the December released "production" dmg of Chimera, or are you compiling it on your own?

I'm using a chimera daily build from &lt;<http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/alpha-downloads.html>&gt; because it has code in it that prevents chimera from crashing when the X server behaves inappropriately. And that code is the CVS version of togl, a Tk OpenGL widget, from &lt;<http://togl.sourceforge.net/>&gt;.

Do you have access to SnowLeopard? I believe this should be fixed in SnowLeopard, but I forget the exact means to reproduce it, so if you could verify it, that would be great (and if not, let me know what build you're running, so I can test again in SL).

It still fails with 10.6's X11 server. Will try newer XQuartz next.

Do you have download of XQuartz 2.4.1 beta available? 2.4.0 won't install on 10.6, so I am unable to test it.

Can you please test with 2.5.0 for Snow Leopard. If this is still happening, can you please give me exact reproduction steps using Chimera (I don't use that software normally, so please be verbose)

I need to be able to return the Snow Leopard machine back to it's default Apple state when I'm through testing. With previous versions of Xquartz I had to have a separate disk with OS X on it, is that still true? I didn't see any uninstall instructions in the wiki.

The Snow Leopard version does not overwrite the system-provided X11. Unless you're worried about disk usage, you should be able to just leave it there and decide which one you want to start by choosing X11.app or XQuartz.app

If you really want to delete it, you just need to remove /Library/Launch\*/org.macosforge.xquartz.\* /opt/X11 /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app
