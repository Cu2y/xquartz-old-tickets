X11.app does not start from its icon
====================================


Hello,

I installed the latest version of X11 (2.3.2) and when I try to launch it by double clicking on the icon, it bounces a minute and stops, never giving access to its menu. The icon appears in the dock but right clicking on says the "application does not answer". Nothing happen on the console and in the terminal I checked pstree and DISPLAY:

echo $DISPLAY ; pstree -s X11

/tmp/launch-aVyaO1/:0

-+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd

Then, I can start X11 by typing startx in the terminal and I get :

startx &

X11 then works properly but with two icons in the dock if the one oppened before was not forced to quit.

Some additionnal informations that could be related

-   when I launch a terminal, it hangs without giving me the prompt. I have to Ctrl-c to get it. I tried removing all init files (.bashrc, .profile, etc) without any effect on any of the story above.

<!-- -->

-   I have both fink and macport installed.

<!-- -->

-   I already had some similar troubles before <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/108>. At the end, I was pointed toward <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/126> but I don't have that problem.

Any help would be appreciated.

Well that is the heart of your problem. Try removing ALL of your init files:
~/.profile ~/.bashrd ~/.bash\_profile /etc/profile /etc/bashrc

Join the x11-users mailing list (see the link on the left) as that's a more appropriate venue to discuss this issue since you'll get more eyes and possibly help others as well.
