Xquatz not opening when a user account is managed on Mac OS 10.8 upwards
========================================================================


Hi

Wondering if anyone is aware of this issue. If a user on Mac OS 10.8 or 10.9 is managed with Parental Control, xQuartz will prompt user to authenticate to allow the app to launch. You either select Always Allow or Allow Once. WHen i select Always allow it will ask me again to put my admin username and password, once that is done it will keep asking me to authenticate again to allow X11 or Xquartz to launch.

Xquartz running under an admin account has no problem. Only on a user that is managed with parental control.

Any ideas? or a work around? My situation is in a school environment and given student admin access is not ideal.

OS X bug. There's nothing we can do about it.

It has to do with the fact that X11 is just very different than normal mac applications, so it just doesn't fit the mold and thus fails. Sorry.
