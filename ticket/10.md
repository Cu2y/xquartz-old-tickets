    I just want you to tell me a program that you're trying to use that doesn't work and give me the steps I need to take to execute said program and see it not working.

    Okay the programs I use that need 8-bit are really huge and not open source so I put together a simple example program.

    To build:

    gcc pc.c -o pc -L/usr/X11/lib -lX11

    To build a version with lots of debug info:

    gcc -DEBUG pc.c -o pc -L/usr/X11/lib -lX11

    To run:

    $ ./pc
    Usage ./pc class depth
     examples:
       ./pc PseudoColor 8
       ./pc TrueColor 24

    With an Xserver that has a 24-bit TrueColor visual:

    $ ./pc TrueColor 24

    With an Xserver that has a 15-bit DirectColor visual:

    $ ./pc DirectColor 15

    With an Xserver that has an 8-bit PseudoColor visual:

    $ ./pc PseudoColor 8

    You should get a window with a line or two for 10 seconds and then the window will disapper.

    mzs

    PS: Right now you get the expected "visual not found" error when you try to run it with PseudoColor 8-bit because the XMatchVisualInfo() fails. But when I run in an 8-bit Xvnc server that works fine, as does my legacy 8-bit X11 app.

    PPS: This sample pc program is so simple it does not repaint or anything. It is best to have X11.app and the window manager already running and not have anything cover the window that pops-up. Otherwise you may get a really strange window pop-up.

Ok, so now I understand this a bit more. You actually need an 8bit Pseudocolor visual. The server itself doesn't need to be 8bit (but in Tiger, setting the server to 8bit enabled the 8bit Pseudocolor visual).

-   **Summary** changed from *8-bit color mode doesn't work* to *8-bit visuals don't work in TrueColor*

git has code to enable a 256 color server, but 8bit visuals in TrueColor is still broken.

pc.c is buggy! ugg. I've been using this to debug, and it is certainly buggy. It causes an 8bit Xserver on linux to go black while running. The reason is that it completely changes the colormap to the one created (which is undefined). Furthermore, it uses the white/black pixel values as sepcified in the screen's default color map rather than the window's color map.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
