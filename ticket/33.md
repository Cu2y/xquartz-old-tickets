Odd momentary Dock launch when Xquartz -version is run
======================================================


First noticed when using Fink, but also occurs when running Xquartz -version, a very brief Dock launch is noticed when then vanishes. Also at that time, there is a brief flash in the current focused window when focus it taken away and very quickly returned.

No problems seem to result from this, but is it annoying and somewhat confusing.

The effect started with the X11-2.1.1 package.
