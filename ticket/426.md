Crash in X11 2.5.22 (OpenGL related)
====================================


X11 will crash after running some OpenGL content. My experiences have all been VTK (<http://www.vtk.org>) related, but unaware if this is the only way to reproduce the crash. One way to reproduce the crash is with the VTK related program, Paraview (<http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html>). I find just starting and then quitting Paraview is enough to generate the crash. However, even while using Paraview I'd had a similar crash.

I've attached a crash report which shows the error. The example data file I attached may or may not be necessary. To use the example file: File-&gt;Open (All Types)-&gt;image.vtk. A little image should appear.

Just to be certain, are you running with:

export LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_INDIRECT=1

I'm assuming you are, but there might be some weird path with the remote host trying to do software GL on the remote client. It's worth just verifying that the problem persists when you do that.

Yes, even with the export command, I see the same issue.

I am able to reproduce the problem using paraview, then File-&gt;quit

This is a regression from this commit:

It looks like this setting of pDraw to NULL got accidently switched in <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver/commit/?id=ed7ccc481ad1caaa518cafe944c2327a5d0b6c65>
