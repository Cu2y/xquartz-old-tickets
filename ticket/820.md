xQuartz 2.7.5 is badly broken on OSX 10.6.8
===========================================


Greetings,

> I updated xQuartz from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5 tonight (no hits, no runs, no errors). I'm running a mac mini (2009) OSX 10.6.8, NVidia, Intel Core 2 Duo...

> Following the upgrade to 2.7.5 both cpu monitors on iStats are pegged on xQuartz startup... and this goes on for several minutes; gimp starts eventually, but is very slow to start and is very sluggish afterwards. xClock does not start immediately ... but will eventually start after a minute and a half, or so. It shows running in the process list, but no display for several minutes. While waiting for xclock to start|display both cpu monitors on iStats menus are pegged and remain pegged for several minutes after xclock finally starts|displays. xterm seems normal, but cannot launch xclock from there either--- takes forever/

> > xQuartz 2.7.5 is not useable on this system ... I removed 2.7.5 completely and reinstalled 2.7.4 / back to normal.

> > kind regards,

> > Mark H. Harris

What processes are taking CPU? Is this the fc-cache issue that we've been discussing on xquartz-dev or something else?

I have the exact same problem on my 10.6.8 machine, on which I've just upgraded from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5

for me fc-cache is indeed the issue

I run X11 in full-screen mode, and I noticed immediately on first startup that the CPUs were working far too hard and that the system log was filled with messages from "startx" and "privileged\_startx" listing font directories with the error message "failed to write cache".

I note that if I clean out my fontconfig directories and run "sudo fc-cache -v -s -f -r" and "fc-cache -v -f -r" (note the "-r") then all is fine (they mention stats about each font directory without any subsequent error and then say "Succeeded" at the end), but if I run "sudo font\_cache -v -s -f" then I see that the same fc-cache command running, complete with the "-r", but it complains for every font directory: "failed to write cache" and my fontconfig directories are left with numerous empty \*TMP\* files.

The "font\_cache" script seems to insist on running a full "fc-cache -v -s -f -r" every time X starts again, yet if I manually run it without the "-f -r" then it skips each existing cache insisting that it is valid, and completes happily saying "succeeded".

Similarly for me xclock and emacs take forever to start and chew CPU at full throttle while trying to start. I'm not sure if this is related to the fc-cache issue or not, but it could well be. It is odd though that they still start extremely slowly even after a successful manual run of fc-cache.

I also run an identical X11 configuration on a 10.9 machine, though without any fonts installed in my home directory, and so far fc-cache been working fine. I don't have everything re-built and re-installed on that system yet, but xclock starts extremely quickly and there has never been any error from it in the system log.

Those of you with issues... are your machines 32bit or 64bit ?

I am running my kernel in 64-bit mode....

I am running 10.6.8:

    Darwin scrappy 10.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.8.0: Tue Jun  7 16:33:36 PDT 2011; root:xnu-1504.15.3~1/RELEASE_I386 i386

I was getting errors running fc-cache on 2.7.5 like these:

    # ugtar@scrappy : ~
    $ fc-cache -f -r -v
    /opt/X11/share/fonts: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 10 dirs
    /opt/X11/share/fonts: failed to write cache
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/100dpi: caching, new cache contents: 398 fonts, 0 dirs
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/100dpi: failed to write cache
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/75dpi: caching, new cache contents: 398 fonts, 0 dirs
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/75dpi: failed to write cache
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/OTF: caching, new cache contents: 23 fonts, 0 dirs
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/OTF: failed to write cache
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/Speedo: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs
    /opt/X11/share/fonts/Speedo: failed to write cache

I've downgraded back to 2.7.4 and I was able to rebuild my font caches with the above command successfully, and now everything is running nice and peppy again.

I just installed 2.7.6\_rc1 and the problem persists. I'm running 10.6.8 on a Core Duo black MacBook.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

No, this is resolved in 2.7.6\_rc1. Perhaps you're seeing something else. Please open a new ticket with relevant information.

Not sure what to say that wasn't said here already.

As you can see in the screenshot, the same thing is happening, and continues to happen for about five minutes.

I'm not doubting that you are seeing the same effect, but that does not imply the same cause. Please file a new ticket and attach a spindump.
