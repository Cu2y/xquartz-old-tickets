Intuos4 Graphic Tablet is not working under XQuartz 2.7.2\_beta4 (xorg-server 1.12.0.901)
=========================================================================================


Hi,
I have updated to beta4, everything works - the apple bluetooth mouse, but not my intuos 4. With the pen I can only tap on the menu of the X-server, e.g. Applications/Edit/Window/Help and select whatever I want, but then, nothing. I can't select anything, not even move a window around. I have the latest wacom driver installed 6.2.0w4.
I am on a MacBook Air, 10.6.8, KDE 3.5.10

xev gives me = xev.txt

---

xinput test pen: gives me nothing :-(

---

xinput --test-xi2 gives me: = xinput\_test-xi2.txt

---

it doesn't matter if I am in rootless or full screen mode. I have attached a second monitor, but doesn't matter either (I turned it on/off) - it does not work in both cases.

Christof
