Can't forward display from server to X11 version 2.5.0 client.
==============================================================


Ever since I updated to 2.5.0 X11 client on my MacBook Pro running 10.5.8 with latest security update 2010-002 I am not able forward DISPLAY to my x11 client. I have no problem with forwarding DISPLAY to a very old X11 1.0. I had no problem forwarding DISPLAY before this update of both Apple 10.5.8 Security Update 2010-002 and X11 2.5.0. I did a check of netstat on the server and notice that x11 doesn't even start a network connection to the client for some unknown reason. I see the other x11 connection to my very old X11 1.0.
Any idea what happen with either Apple Security update 2010-002 which has X11 update and this X11 2.5.0 that would do this.

Please ask for support on the x11-users mailing list. There is no bug here. You likely have ssh misconfigured. Also, check out the list FAQ:
