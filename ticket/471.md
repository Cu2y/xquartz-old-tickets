keyboard mapping is broken by NX
================================


When using XQuartz 2.6.0 with 10.6.6 and NX Client 3.4.0-8, the keyboard gets garbled, exactly in the manner posted here by someone else 2 years ago:

<http://forums.macnn.com/82/applications/392366/x11-keyboard-has-been-remapped/>

In particular, the mapping gets crazy like this:

    q = '-'
    w = '='
    e = BACKSPACE
    r = NOT SURE
    t = 'w'
    y = 'q'

    z = 5
    x = 6
    c = 7
    v = 8
    b = 0
    n = 'x'
    m = 'c'

    DELETE = ','

I have had to uninstall XQuartz and revert back to X11 2.3.5 to get my keyboard working again under NX Client.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Summary** changed from *keyboard mapping screwed* to *keyboard mapping is broken by NX*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.6.2*

You don't need to uninstall XQuartz to use 2.3.6 ... they co-exist... just use 2.3.6 (X11.app) instead of 2.6.0 (XQuartz.app)

There's really not much info to go on here. Do the following (from 2.6.0):

    1) Run xterm.
    2) Type in the xterm ... is it broken?
    3) Run NX
    4) Type in NX ... assuming broken...
    5) Go back to your xterm
    6) Type in xterm ... is it broken?

Please provide the output of 'xmodmap -pke' for both the working and broken state (you may need to copy/paste the command into xterm while "broken"

From my experience using NX in Linux, NX is badly designed. It sends keycodes instead of KeySyms to the remote NX session. This causes the remote session to behave badly, unless you install the local keyboard map into the remote X session. It is a problem with NX and not the X server. However, that should have no effect on the local keyboard mapping.
