You have set your DISPLAY envvar to rfx.local:0, and the machine "rfx.local" doesn't seem to be listening on that TCP port.

As for getting this stuff to work like it does on Linux, it does. If you ran that on Linux, you'd get the same failure because the TCP port is not being listened to no matter what OS is the client.

Is "rfx.local" some remote system? If so, you should use ssh instead. If it's your local system, then stop overriding DISPLAY and let launchd set it for you.
