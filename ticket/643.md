Resolution issue running Cadence tool
=====================================


Hi, I am a student of USC, Electrical Engineering. I have a MacBook Pro 13 with Lion and had Cadence (tool for VLSI design) working fine. I upgraded to Mountain Lion a couple of days back and had to install Xquartz for the X11 display. But now, Cadence is giving a resolution mismatch and am not able to click on the Cadence Library I want. Also the entire window has a weird pink color and extremely small font size. Since mouse click is not working in the X11 window, I am not able to open my files. I have spoken to Apple care but couldnt find a solution. Hoping for a bug fix at the earliest, Thanks!
