option-click doesn't paste
==========================


With the latest beta update to X11, option-click paste on my laptop seems to be broken in xterm. With a mouse plugged in, middle mouse button paste still works. Unfortunately, if there's no mouse at hand, it's impossible to paste into xterm.

OS X 10.6.3
XQuartz 2.5.1\_beta3 (xorg-server 1.8.0)
