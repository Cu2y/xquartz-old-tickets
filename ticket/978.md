XQuartz keeps opening and closing
=================================


I installed XQuarz 2.7.5 on a iMAc

> Model Name: iMac
> Model Identifier: iMac13,2
> Processor Name: Intel Core i7
> Processor Speed: 3.4 GHz
> Number of Processors: 1
> Total Number of Cores: 4
> L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB
> L3 Cache: 8 MB
> Memory: 32 GB
> Boot ROM Version: IM131.010A.B05
> SMC Version (system): 2.11f14
> Serial Number (system): C02KD3MZDNMP
> Hardware UUID: 9B1E7D5A-425F-502A-9D71-AAED311AFEE8

under Mavericks 10.9.2. When I start XQuartz or it is started through an application (e.g. Autodocktools) it falls into a permanent cycle of opening and closing until I restart the computer. Can't even kill it with force quit.

Hope for a fix.

Thanks.

Hans-Peter Kohler
