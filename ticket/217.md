X11 root window is "lost" after successive toggling
===================================================


Hi Jeremy,

I dropped in the new X11.bin. I see "XQuartz 2.3.2\_rc4 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple29)" in the About X11 window, so the binary is being used.

I'm having root window problems, perhaps similar to those reported by Viv Kendon, if memory serves. For reference, I have the X11 "Full-screen mode" box checked and the "Auto-show menu bar in full-screen mode" unchecked.

With X11.app not open, I type "xsetroot -solid red" in Terminal. This automatically starts X11. I click on the X11 dock icon and I see a solid red screen. I do "command-option-a" and my Desktop appears with X11 as the active application. I immediately do another "command-option-a" and the menu bar disappears but no red screen. I still see my Desktop, and clicking on it simply activates Finder.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *assigned*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.3.2*

When I do the second cmd-option-a, I get a red root as expected...

Do you have multiple monitors? What's your system spec? What is the output of 'defaults read org.x.X11'?

I am using the built-in display on my MacBook. No other monitors.

Ok, I've seen this a couple times now, but I'm not sure how to reproduce (so I'm not sure how to test if I fix it...)
