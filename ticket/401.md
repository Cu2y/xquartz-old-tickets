Xterms lose their location when second display is attached/detached
===================================================================


This is on a MBP.

1.  open a few xterms. arrange them as you want.

<!-- -->

1.  Attach a second display and see them all move to the new bigger display but on top of each other.

<!-- -->

1.  Move them back to their original place on the built in display of MBP

4, Detach the display and see them all move on top of each other on the left side.

This has been a problem with pretty much every version of MacOS 10 and with both Xquartz & X11 server. FWIW, the larger external display is on the \*left\* of MBP.

What would be ideal is for X windows (or Xterms) to remember where they were in two display mode as welll as a single display mode and get moved accordingly when the second display is attached or detached. Thanks!
