xquartz seems to cause HDCP problems, AirPlay devices not found with OS 10.10.3
===============================================================================


Everything was working with OS 10.10.3 , then I installed xquartz 2.7.7 and wireshark. Immediately Safari could not play netflix streams, error s7361-1253, something about an extra display which is not HDCP compliant. Also AirPlay devices could not be found on 10.10.3 os x, whereas it works for ios and 10.9 os x.
I uninstalled xquartz and rebooted, but still no netflix stream nor AirPlay devices. bug bug 21090925 at apple submitted too.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

XQuartz has nothing to do with that.
