XQuartz not working with dual screen with Mavericks
===================================================


I use a MacbookAir with second external screen (dual screens). It used to be that XQuartz worked perfectly, and I could move an Xwindow between screens with no issues. Then with a recent update of OSX Xwindows were still visible on either screen but had rigid positioning. Now, with an update to Mavericks, an XQuartz window is not visible (it disappears) if dragged onto the second screen. If I click into an Xwindow on the primary screen all other (non XQuartz) windows in the second screen are covered by a black screen. They are revealed again if I come out of XQuartz.

Thanks in advance for your help.
