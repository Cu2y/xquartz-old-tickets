Xquartz not working to open up my Bible Explorer 4
==================================================


I updated my MacBook Pro to Maverick and after completion of the downloaded software, I notice it kept asking me about X11 because a software application on my MacBook required it to open. So I looked up X11 and found out it will no longer work with my updated Maverick operating system. My Bible Explorer app utilizes X11 and so I installed XQuartz which suppose to be the newest version to X11, however, it's still not the solution to my dilemma because it keeps prompting me that "X11 cannot be found". So is XQuartz the update to X11 or not and if it is, how can I get Bible Explorer to identify with XQuartz being X11 replacement?

Prior to OS X Leopard, X11 applications assumed the app was /Applications/Utilities/X11.app and did some hackery to launch it when their app was launched and set their DISPLAY environment variable. About 8 years ago, they should've updated their software to no longer make this assumption and instead only do that hackery if the DISPLAY environment variable wasn't set. If DISPLAY is set (which it is on Leopard and later, including with XQuartz.app), then they should just use it.

You might be able to work around this by renaming XQuartz.app to X11.app
