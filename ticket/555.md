Mouse pointer is not aligned with the point where the click occurs in 2.7.2 beta1/2
===================================================================================


The mouse pointer is be positioned higher than the point where the click occurs. I noticed this when launching Gimp after the upgrade to 2.7.2 beta and thought my Wacom Intuos 3 was misbehaving. It means for instance that I have to click above the menus to open them. It works fine again when downgrading to 2.7.1.

Can you try isolating the cause for me? With 2.7.1 installed, backup the server binary:

    cd /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/
    sudo cp X11.bin X11.bin-2.7.1

Next, install XQuartz-2.7.2\_beta2, then restore the old server binary:

    cd /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/
    sudo cp X11.bin X11.bin-2.7.2_beta2
    sudo cp X11.bin-2.7.1 X11.bin

If it works, this means it's a server issue. If it still fails, then it's probably a client issue.

The problem with the cursor coordinates in 2.7.2\_beta2 vanished after cp X11.bin-2.7.1 -&gt; X11.bin as you suggested -- this means it's a server issue.

It works with both mouse and intuos if I do what you outlined, suggesting it is a server issue.

I was wrong initially. The mouse works as it should also with the plain 2.7.2\_beta2, but my Wacom Intuos 3 is off vertically by 20 pixels or so with 2.7.2\_beta1/2, which wasn't the case with 2.7.1. Sorry about the confusion.

I can confirm this bug in combination with a Wacom graphics tablet (Bamboo). Reverting to 2.7.1 resolves the problem. The problem does not occur when using the mouse.

The problem is still there in beta3 using wacom intuos3 with mouse.

I have a fix for this. Please try beta4 when it is out (probably next weekend-ish).
