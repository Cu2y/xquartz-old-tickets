Window wont expand to fill screen
=================================


On my new Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) I run X11 apps remotely over ssh from RedHat (and various other) linux with the "-Y" flag. Currently, I am limited in dragging the window up about two thirds of the way to the top of the screen. It stops there and wont drag any higher, no matter what I do. Hitting the green "maximize" button on the window expands it up to only the same height as well. This happens whether or not a second monitor is attached. I tried changing the resolution on both monitors, but no matter what the setting, the window will not fill in the top third of the screen. Thanks for looking in to this and let me know if there's anything I can add.

I tried un-setting the Mission Control preference, "Displays have separate Spaces" I saw in some other threads, and it seems to have fixed the issue. Sorry I missed that before filing the bug report.

Hi,
Same issue here with Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D136) and XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2). The "Displays have separate Spaces" workaround fixes the issue but I still thing this is a bug. I mean I have to change a system wide setting only for displaying X Forward windows.
Regards,
