Crash on select in Gimp (works in 2.7.1\_stable)
================================================


X11 crashes on select. Crash report attached. Not sure how to launch X in debug.

Under 2.7.2\_beta4 2012.03.31 steps:

> Launched Gimp in X

> Open image

> choose crop method from tool palette

> click and drag in image

I'm happy to provide any more info, testing, etc.
