Motif widget contextual menu cursor trap
========================================


Platform: Mac OS X 10.6.2, XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.7.3)

I found out that I would lose my click control every time I right click to show the contextual menu inside Xmgrace. This happened after a certain update of Xquartz since I remember clearly I was still able to use Xmgrace right after I purchased my macbook pro (bundled with 10.6).

A quick search on this reveals similar issues on the other platform:

> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543647>

From there I got a simplified test case that perhaps Xquartz developers can use to figure out the problem.

Here is how you can reproduce with the attached test case:
1) install macports
2) sudo port install openmotif
3) tar xvf mousetrap.tar -C /tmp
4) cd /tmp/mousetrap; make
5) ./mousetrap

My test on leopard 10.5.8/Xquartz 2.4.0(server 1.5.3-apple14)/intel iMac behaves normally. See Picutre1.png for what supposed to be for this test case.

Can you please try to narrow down the delta that causes this problem.

Replace /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin with different versions from:

<http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/SL/>

Note that the 1.4.x versions are for X11.app, not XQuartz.app ... just try the 1.5.x, 1.6.x, and 1.7.x versions and let me know what the last working version was.

Thanks.

X11.bin-1.6.5-apple3 and earlier binaries do work but 1.7.x don't work.

Thanks... so this is a regression with the 1.7 server... hmm...

According to the RedHat bug, this is an issue in lesstif and not something to be addressed in the core X11 libraries. I'll track that bug and patch lesstif in MacPorts when there is a fix. Feel free to open a bug with MacPorts for this, so it's in my radar still.

Hi, Are you sure it's not X11 related? It seems that fedora's already have patch to Xorg regarding this issue...

-   **Resolution** *invalid* deleted

At the time I posted that, the known fix was a change to lesstif.

Now, the change is in xorg-server.

Peter will likely be merging this into 1.7-nominations which means we'll pick it up in the next beta.

We have the workaround in what will be 2.5.0\_rc1
