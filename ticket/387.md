BadAtom X11 Error with fpGUI
============================


When running pascal programs based on fpGUI, an X11 based interface package, I get an error if the application needs to create the top level (root?) X11 window. but only then. If there is already a toplevel window, for example because xterm runs, then the application open its window and everything behaves as expected.

the problematic call is this:

XGetWMProtocols(FDisplay, AWindow, @Protocols, @Count);

gdb shows these values (if there is an X11 window, the values are exactly the same):

4: COUNT = 0
3: PROTOCOLS = 0x0
2: AWINDOW = 6291457
1: this-&gt;FDISPLAY = 0x803a00

This call produces this X11 error:

X Error of failed request: BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)
Major opcode of failed request: 18 (X\_ChangeProperty)
Atom id in failed request: 0x0
Serial number of failed request: 103
Current serial number in output stream: 104

System: Mac OS X 10.6.3

X11 version:
michael% X -version
X.org Release 7.3
X.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple53
Build Date: 20100211

Similar on Intel 10.5.8, with X11 2.4.0 installed from xorg, which is
X.org Release 7.4
X.Org X Server 1.5.3-apple14
Build Date: 20090812

Thanks for investigating. Could you please open a bug report at
<http://xquartz.macosforge.org> with this info, and I'll take a look at it for the
next release.
Could you also let me know how to get your 'helloworld' on my system for easy testing?
Thanks, Jeremy

****\* How to build the fpGUI libs/units and helloworld ****\*

Install the FreePascal compiler with fink:

> fink install fpc

Download the source tarball of RC2 of fpGUI from sourceforge:

> <http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpgui/files/fpGUI/0.7-rc2/fpgui-0.7.rc2.tar.gz/download>

Extract the tarball and cd to the directory "fpgui-0.7.rc2/src".

Patch the sources:

> sed -i.bak 's| users, {| *users, {|g' corelib/x11/fpg\_x11.pas
> *

> sed -i.bak 's|GetUserName(TUID(info.st\_uid));|IntToStr(info.st\_uid);|g' corelib/x11/fpg\_x11.pas

> sed -i.bak 's|GetGroupName(TGID(info.st\_gid));|IntToStr(info.st\_gid);|g' corelib/x11/fpg\_x11.pas

Build the fpGUI libraries:

> ./build.sh

Change to the folder of helloworld:

> cd ../examples/corelib/helloworld

Build helloworld:

> fpc -gl -gw -Fu../../../lib/i386-darwin helloworld.pas

Run helloworld:

> ./helloworld

Building the fpGUI libs/units with debug information is more involved. I'll post it if it's needed.

Did this work with an older version of X11? If so, can you tell me what is the most recent version that worked?

This was my first try of fpGUI and it failed. So, I have no idea, whether there is an earlier version, which works. I do not have a system with a version earlier than 2.4.0, except a PowerMac on 10.4. Output of "X -version":

XFree86 Version 4.4.0 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6600)

But I guess this does not really help.

KMS.

Does the Tiger version have this bug?

You can install earlier versions (than 2.4.0) on Leopard.

trying on powerpc Tiger:

When compiling, I received: Fatal: Can't find unit users used by fpg\_x11.

The reason is that the first patch did not work. There are 2 spaces between "users," and "{". Probably scrapped from the output.

The second error was: Fatal: Can't find unit fpg\_base used by HelloWorld.

The reason is that on powerpc the command to compile HelloWorld must be:

> fpc -gl -gw -Fu../../../lib/powerpc-darwin helloworld.pas

After this the program was built. When executed from terminal.app, it crashed with an exception because it could not start x11. In xterm it gave a very similar error as above. The only differences were the serial numbers. 103 became 102, and 104 became 103.

Trying on 10.5 with various versions later.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.5.1* to *later*

Ok, since this issue has existed since Tiger, it's getting pushed back.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
