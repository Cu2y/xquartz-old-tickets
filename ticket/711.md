X11 problems with Abaqus v6.11
==============================


Abaqus v6.11 is a finite element analysis package for engineering that I have successfully been running through a Unix server using ssh through the old X11 package from OS 10.5, using a early-2008 MacBook. When I try to run Abaqus using the exact same method on my Late-2012 iMac, using xQuartz, I am presented with the following error:

    "X Error: code 16 major 149 minor 28: BadLength (poly request too large or internal Xlib length error)."

This error is repeated 80 times.

When the xWindow fails, I get the following message:

    "Write failed: Broken pipe"

The server is running Rocks 5.2 (Chimichanga)

At this point, the odds are about 30-70 in favor of the xWindow not opening. This quite frustrating for me, as the main reason why I dished out for a desktop system was so that I could have a dedicated connection to my research cluster.

Is this still an issue with 2.7.5?
