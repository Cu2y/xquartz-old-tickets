VIM does not work with arrow keys
=================================


If you use VIM with arrow keys, you will observe the strange behavior of seeing VIM jump around word by word instead of letter by letter.

doing: vim --cmd 'set t\_RV=' fixes this. It makes VIM ignore the terminal version escape string. However, this used to work in the shipped X11...

This is in XQuartz 2.5.0
