Cursor stuck in uppper-left corner after a display switch
=========================================================


Bonjour,

On my MacBook runnning 10.6.2 (and XQuartz 2.3.4), my cursor stays sometimes stuck in the upper left corner after I change my display from the main screen to an external screen (or vice-versa).
The situation goes back to normal once the display is changed again or the X server restarted.

Best regards,
Vincent Boudry.
