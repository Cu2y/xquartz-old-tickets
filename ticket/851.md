Computer locks up when x11Quartz opens.
=======================================


I downloaded the Mavericks OS a couple of weeks ago. I tried to open WordSearch9 Bible software and was told to download the Quartz software to replace the older version of x11. When x11Quartz opens it is accompanied by a small xterm window that displays the following: "bash-3.2$".

When the xterm window appears the screen turns black with the exception of the xterm window and then the computer locks up.I am forced to cycle the power button and restart.I have tried downloading new file and reloading, all to no avail. Please help as I have expended hours with no change in condition and I am no programmer.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

\*If\* the system is locked up, that's certainly not an XQuartz bug.

Otherwise, it sounds like you are in fullscreen mode. Hit cmd-opt-a to toggle fullscreen.
