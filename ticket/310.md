You need to be a bit more descriptive in your bug report. Please tell me why IDL doesn't work. What is happening? You reported this as a crash. Can you please provide the crash trace.

when i click the icon "IDL 6.2", it should first pop up x11, and pop up IDL window. with the latest x11, it pops up x11, but kills IDL without popping it.
i am in the middle of an experiment and i badly need IDL to plot the data coming out. now, i am using my student's computer (PC!), but i really want to use my mac. so while someone figure out what is wrong with the new x11, i would like to de-install the new x11, and install the old version of x11 that worked. so can you tell me first how i can de-install the new x11 please?

many thanks

Well seeing as how you're the only person with this problem, I doubt it is an issue with X11. It's more likely an issue with IDL. As you mentioned, IDL is what fails to start. I'd be more than happy to help you solve the problem, but software problems don't just go away by ignoring them and hoping someone else fixes it.

Can you please try starting IDL like normal, then attach the file /var/log/system.log to this bug report? That should provide useful information.

Yeah, your idl is crashing... this has nothing to do with X11 as far as I can tell... You should contact the developers of IDL. Also, are you aware that your version of IDL is for PowerPC? You should see if there is a native (x86) version available, so you don't need to run it through Rosetta.

OK. but IDL worked with the old version of X11. And I want to go back to that mode for now. So can you tell me how I can un-install the newest X11?

Just install your old version. Click on "releases" to the left.
