Downgrade from XQuartz-2.7.1\_rc2 to XQuartz-2.7.1\_rc1 doesn't work
====================================================================


After encountering instability in rc2 (see ticket 538), I tried to reinstall rc1 over it. This did not work: XQuartz wouldn't launch anymore. I eventually resorted to manually trashing /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz and then running the rc1 installer, and now it seems okay.

Inspection of /var/log/system.log seems to tell the tale: it looks suspiciously like X11.bin wasn't downgraded:

although I'll attach the DiagnosticReports file for completeness.

This is a bug in the installer or packagemaker (I'm not sure which). Either way, I've told it to allow downgrading, and it's not downgrading. You can probably inspect /var/log/install.log and notice that it says something to the effect of "Not installing Xquartz.app due to newer version present" ... that's what is causing this.

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Expected*
-   **Milestone** changed from *OSX* to *2.7.1*

I figured out a workaround for this, so the next version will allow downgrades (to it), but 2.7.0 through 2.7.1\_rc2 can't be downgraded to.

The workaround is to delete XQuartz.app first.
