FOLLOWUP to Closed Ticket \#762
===============================


Hi -- the email I just recieved is from a noreply address, and I don't see the related ticket [\#⁠762](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/762) that was closed, so writing here --

Thanks. In the context of the use case I mention, it is not correct behavior: X on a standalone, non-networked imac should not \*necessarily\* interfere w/ normal imac functioning -- the imac runs the xserver, not vice-versa. The imac should be the master of X, not the slave of X.

The typical X use case will be in a network with multiple nodes, and the example you mention makes sense. But Quartz is for imacs, and the use case I mention is relevant. That's why I think this should be configurable. Otherwise, it prevents the intended, normal operation of this imac configuration. That makes this behavior a flaw in design intent.

Please just comment in the original ticket. There's a link in the email, or you can just navigate to it on this site (or search for it in the search bar on top).

What are you talking about here? X11.app is an OS X Application that provides an X11 server. There is no master/slave relationship involved.

Actually, the typical use case is with X11 clients local to the server.

> But Quartz is for imacs, and the use case I mention is relevant.

The application is XQuartz.

I never said your use case wasn't relevant. I'm saying that we're doing the correct thing for your use case. There is no way for us to tell if your X11 client windows are safe to terminate.

> That's why I think this should be configurable. Otherwise, it prevents the intended, normal operation of this imac configuration.

What do you mean by "normal operation of this imac configuration"? Many applications will prompt you upon quit if they can't guarantee that there is no unsaved data. Try quitting Terminal.app when ssh'd into another machine or with an emacs window open. This is exactly the same behavior.

> That makes this behavior a flaw in design intent.

No. This is correct design. We prompt you because we don't want to kill your applications without letting you save your work.

Please feel free to bring this up on the mailing list. Filing bug reports is not the avenue for this discussion.
