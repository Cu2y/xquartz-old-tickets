hard drive crash
================


My son plays heroesofnewerth. About a week ago he was the last person on our Mac os x 10.5.8 When I got up in the morning & tried to turn on our Mac it wouldn't boot. I took it to our local Apple shop & the diagnosis was a complete hard drive failure. All data was lost & unrecoverable.
I had them install a new hard drive ($300) now 10.6.8 We got it back yesterday & my son downloaded heroesofnewerth again, but it wouldn't load. He asked for my help. I read the info displayed on the install window & saw that there was a warning that the file could damage the computer.
I suspected something to do with your game was responsible for the hard drive crash & now after seeing this warning I have no doubt at all.
Why would you release a game with a down load capability for a system that could crash the system it is being installed on?
I have pasted the warning for you to see.
This type of file can harm your computer. Do you want to keep HoNClient-2.5.0.dmg anyway?
I hope I have provided the correct information for your review. Thanks Owen

I have no idea what Heros Of Newerth is. This is the first time I've heard of it, but...

1) There's no way that such software could cause a harddrive failure

2) That message is displayed on the first run of any application that you download from the internet. You'll see it if you install Firefox, Opera, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Hulu, ... anything.
