-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

This has nothing to do with the security update. The problem was that you had a newer version than 2.7.0, and you then installed 2.7.0 over it after the sec update. There was a bug in the packager used to make the 2.7.0 package which caused it to not downgrade the app bundle as part of the downgrade. I advise you to install the latest 2.7.1 rc, or delete XQuartz.app and re-run the 2.7.0 install.
