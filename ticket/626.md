App icon on dark backgrounds
============================


Xquartz has a great icon, but on dark backgrounds, like the default OS X 10.8 wallpaper, the dark icon gets lost and looks muddy. Simply reversing all the colors in the icon made a huge difference in the Dock. Would it be extraneous to include an option of a light or dark icon?

If you want to make a new icon with higher DPI options for retina and better support for dark backgrounds, that would be welcome... but that's not really my forté

Nor mine. I just modified the existing icon. For what it's worth, I've attached it.
