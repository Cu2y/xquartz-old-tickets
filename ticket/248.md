Xquartz Preferences not translated
==================================


Hello. I opened a ticket, [this one](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/247), and the mod (jeremyhu) told me that i could help by translating.

Replying to sircharlo@…:

> Yeah, the preference panes haven't been translated. If you can submit the translations, I'll gladly include them.

I don't know how to do this ! This is the only place i could figure out to ask... Sorry if this is the wrong place.

So, could a mod please tell me how i can translate the interface from English to French...
