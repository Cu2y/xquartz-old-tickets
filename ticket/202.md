With Xquartz 2.3.2\_rc2 oclock and xeyes don't display correctly
================================================================


oclock and xeyes seem to displace the window background graphics underneath the top window bar rather than at the bottom edge of it with the other graphics that appear on top of the background being drawn in what appears to be the proper place in the window.

See the attached screen shot.

This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the included executables as the same commands run on solaris and displayed back onto the Mac show the exact same shifts.
