Lion: Window selection wrong on click
=====================================


    1. Open 2 xterm windows in XQuartz
    2. Switch to the Finder
    3. Click on the first xterm in XQuartz
    4. Go back to the Finder
    5. Click on the second xterm in XQuartz. This currently (incorrectly) activates the *first* xterm, instead of the one that was clicked

It definitely doesn't work for me ... Any possible ideas what could be affecting this?

I click on a window, and the wrong one gets pulled forward with the keyboard focus (which means I start typing and it goes to the wrong window -- naturally this has led to some problems)

What version of X11? Are you using quartz-wm or some other WM?

Running OS 10.7.2, xquartz 2.7.0 (xorg-server 1.11.2) with the default quartz-wm

Ah, it looks like there's an x11 installed from mac ports and somehow that's the thing Xquartz is running:

supamac&gt; ps -ef|grep -i quartz-wm|grep -v grep

> 501 50018 49922 0 Tue10PM ?? 0:01.73 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm

supamac&gt; /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm --version
1.2.0

supamac&gt; /usr/bin/quartz-wm --version
1.2.1

Changing the PATH to ensure /usr/bin/quartz-wm got picked up fixed it.

Thanks!

Ugg. It looks like the wrong version of quartz-wm landed in 2.7.0... =(

I'll fix that up in the next release.

Actually, 2.7.0 has the latest version, but it's just reported as the wrong value. 2.7.1\_rc1 should report 1.2.99.901

So we still need to figure out what's going on here. I can't reproduce it, so please help.

Also, quartz-wm was released OSS, so you can build it yourself and try figuring out what commit introduce the issue. See [this page](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/quartz-wm)

The odds are this was a path error or some idiosyncrasy with my setup. I installed the latest XQuartz using the installer but had another X11 installation from a dependency of another package through mac ports; presumably the XQuartz installer put things in /usr/bin while mac ports put them in /opt, but opt was ahead of /usr/ in my path variable so the wrong quartz-wm was launched. I don't think there's an error with the XQuartz package

No, that wouldn't be the case. XQuartz installs to /opt/X11, and it prefers the /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm over others. MacPorts installs to /opt/local.

You reported that /usr/bin/quartz-wm is ok but /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm is bad. This represents a regression.

-   **Milestone** changed from *2.7.1* to *2.7.2*

Does this happen with quartz-wm-1.2.2 or quartz-wm-1.2.99.902? 1.2.99.902 will be in 2.7.1\_rc2.

In any case, I can't reproduce it.

Also, quartz-wm is OSS now, so if you could do some testing to figure out what commit introduced the bug, that would help.

Thanks.

No response in 3 months and no other reports about this. I can't reproduce the issue, so closing.
