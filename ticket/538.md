quartz-wm is very unstable in 2.7.1\_rc2
========================================


quartz-wm fails regularly under light usage; it was perfectly fine in rc1. Entries in /var/log/system.log vary:

first case:

    Jan 28 22:51:06 pro Dock[166]: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSReleaseWindow: Invalid window 1503
    Jan 28 22:51:06 pro Dock[166]: kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.

second case:

    Jan 29 12:18:28 pro org.macosforge.xquartz.startx[11920]: connection to X server lost

third case:

    Jan 29 12:46:58 pro org.macosforge.xquartz.startx[12588]: waiting for X server to shut down

I'll attach all three DiagnosticReports files, though they look pretty darn similar.

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Expected*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.1*

How can I reproduce this? You say it reproduces easily under light usage, but you don't give steps. Please tell me exactly what you are doing to trigger this issue.

Also, quartz-wm logging would be helpful. Once X11 is running, do this:

    syslog -c quartz-wm -d
    syslog -w -k Facility eq org.macosforge.xquartz

Also, if you could bisect quartz-wm to tell me which commit caused the issue, that would help.

<https://github.com/jeremyhu/quartz-wm/commits/master>

2.7.1\_rc1 has 1.2.99.901

2.7.1\_rc2 has 1.2.99.902

I can tell from your crash logs that this is happening when you try to restore from the dock.

When I restore from the dock, I'm seeing a Dock crash which has been there since Lion, but quartz-wm doesn't crash. I need more information.

Ok, I think I see the issue. This should be fixed in the next rc:

Please verify with 2.7.1\_rc4

Replying to [jeremyhu@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/538#comment:7):

> Please verify with 2.7.1\_rc4

FWIW, just tried 2.7.1\_rc4 and I see the Dock crash. But maybe my crash is different - I see this crash with every version of Xquartz since (and including) 2.7.0. So maybe my machine is messed up - is it possible to uninstall Xquartz completely (to follow with the clean install?).

BTW1: The Apple X11.app does not crash the Dock.
BTW2: I do not see the Dock crash on my home machine (same MacOS 10.7.3, Xquartz 2.7.1\_rc-whatever).

K.O.

Yeah that Dock crash is ... well... Dock crashing. There's not much I can do about it in quartz-wm. It sucks that we happen to trip over whatever that bug is. It's been there since Lion but doesn't appear under certain circumstances. /usr/bin/quartz-wm \*can\* crash the dock in the same way.

I suggest you file a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com>

> Well today, while waiting for someone to get ready to play fut . I ran across the ability to make modifications to the system.cfg file by creating a system.ovr file.

I’ve been toying around with some of the settings, namely the ability to log the chat windows. It appears that the file Chat.log is written instantaneously which in turn means good things for writing a combat log parser. It seems, there is a possibility of actually doing a live one. I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up but I’ve already started working on an after the fact one that could be used once a pvp session or pve session is over.
here’s how it works:

> Create a system.ovr file in the top level <http://www.atfarosario.com.ar/WORDPRESS/?page_id=216> install directory
> Within it put:

g\_chatlog = “1″
log\_IncludeTime = “1″
log\_Verbosity = “1″
log\_FileVerbosity = “1″
The only major limitations of this is, it doesn’t create new logs for each session (hello giant chat log) and it doesn’t separate combat from kinah chat bull, so I need to filter that out.
