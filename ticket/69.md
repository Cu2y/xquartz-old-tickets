Seeing dual X11 icons in dock without display being set in my environment, cannot figure out how to find the culprit
====================================================================================================================


I have seen dual X11 icons in my dock after launch.

It is launched by NX, and I do not directly click on the X11.app, nor do I have it stored in my dock for relaunch.

Post a connect, with two X11 apps showing, I see

    /etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11DisplayOffset 10
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config:X11UseLocalhost yes

I did not read X11UseLocalhost as unsafe in this context, so if I am wrong about that, please let me know.

I did a

time sudo grep -I -R DISPLAY /

and only saw the DISPLAY variable being set by launcher scripts for Thunderbird and Firefox.

ps output, while X11 running:

    dhcp-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa:~$ ps ax | grep X11

      594 s001  R+     0:00.00 grep X11

Obviously, \_something\_ is starting that extra X11 session. Any suggestions for how to find it?

Well...

The ':1' one looks like it's being started by launchd (by looking at the '/bin/bash --login /usr/X11/bin/startx' above it).

The ':0' one looks like it's being started by X11.app. This happens when $DISPLAY is set in the environment incorrectly, and it "falls back" on starting its own instance of the server. This is to allow situations where launchd is disabled or to allow this code to work on Tiger.

I added in some extra debug hooks to the X11.app code. Download this:
<http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/X11.bz2>
Decompress it, and replace /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/MacOS/X11 with it. This should do the trick:

curl -LO <http://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/X11.bz2>
sudo bunzip2 -dc X11.bz2 &gt; /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/MacOS/X11

Please try your situation again, and look at the log file in Console.app. Please post the relevant sections.

I'm guessing that NX sets $DISPLAY.

After replacing the X11 binary with the one in the response, I see only one X11 window.

This was on a fresh boot.

This implies that the next drop will not have the double X11 behavior, unless the debug build was built from the same drop as the last release.

It doesn't look like you used the binary I made for you above... I need the debugging output from that binary to help you with your problem. Please try 2.2.0\_rc2 when I release it later today or tomorrow.
