not working properly when an external display is connected
==========================================================


I am experiencing problems when I connect my MacBookPro to an external display. In this configuration, the external display is the main display, and the laptop display is the secondary. When I open a terminal, it correctly shows up in the main display, but if I try to drag it on the second display, it disappears. Moreover, if I unplug and re-plug the external display, the xterm is automatically moved in the second display (the laptop one), where it is not visible.

I'm running XQuartz 2.7.4 on a MacBookPro running OS X 10.9

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

The workaround for now is to disable "Displays have separate spaces" in Mission Control preferences.

Please file a bug report with <http://bugreport.apple.com> as this is not an issue that can be fixed by XQuartz exclusively.
