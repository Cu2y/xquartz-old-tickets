XQuartz on Mavericks with multiple displays
===========================================


I am using a second monitor via Thunderbolt. When the second monitor is plugged in when I start XQuartz, the xterm window opens on my primary display just fine. When I launch an x11 application from Terminal, the x11 app appears on the second display, but underneath the OSX Menu bar, which means I can't close, minimize, maximize, or move the window. I find the only way to move it is to: enter Mission Control &gt; move x11 application window to primary display &gt; exit Mission Control &gt; resize x11 application window.

If I open XQuartz and launch an x11 application before I plug in the second display, the x11 application appears to be on my primary display in Mission Control, but disappears off screen somewhere when I exit Mission Control.

A fix to this problem, especially the window being stuck under the OSX menu bar would be great. When working with multiple x11 applications at once, it is like the Tower of Hanoi problem trying to manage each window.

Thanks,
John

I have this problem as well, running Mavericks with a Thunderbolt monitor. All X11 apps launched through Alfred (keyboard shortcut/workflow tool) show on my MBP laptop screen, but when sliding them to the external monitor they disappear on that screen. Workaround is to turn off the new Mission Control Prefs setting "Displays have separate Spaces", then it works as before in Mavericks (and as it used to work in Mountain Lion). Just tried today's 2.7.5 update, but it does not fix this issue.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

2.7.5 won't fix the issue because it's an OS X bug, not an XQuartz bug.
