Race condition on X startup
===========================


I typically start XQuartz by means of a login item, a program that I wrote myself (in C) which establishes certain environment settings and then execs /opt/X11/bin/xterm. This pokes the launchd socket and starts the X server as expected. I also have a file ~/.xinitrc.d/00-resources.sh, which is executable, that calls "/opt/X11/bin/xrdb ~/.Xresources" in the foreground.

There's a race condition between these two programs on X startup. Sometimes the xterm starts first, sometimes the resources get loaded (as demonstrated by the fact that the xterm respects the resource settings only sometimes). I know that the resources are always loaded, because in cases where the xterm starts first, I can type "xterm" at its prompt and get a new xterm that does respect the resource settings.

Additional details available upon request, including the source code of the program that starts xterm.

Forgot to mention -- I observed this bug running XQuarts 2.5.1\_rc1, not 2.5.0.

This should be "fixed" in 2.6.2\_rc1 when it is released. We now wait 3 seconds for xinitrc to finish before accepting connections from the launchd FD.

(yes, it just biases the race in xinitrc's favor, so this isn't technically "fixed", but it's good enough for now)
