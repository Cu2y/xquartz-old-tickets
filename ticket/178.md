first xterm created crashes when a subsequently created xterm is exited
=======================================================================


The first xterm created, usually when X11 starts, crashes when
a subsequently (second, third, etc.) xterm is exited by typing
the "exit" shell command and then moving the mouse over the
first xterm created.

eh... I can't reproduce this, and it doesn't seem possible. Can you please narrow down your test case. What version of X11 are you using?
