xauth keys not being maintained over move to different network.
===============================================================


\[ I am using 2.3.0rc4 now, and I \_think\_ this is a recent change since 2.3.0.... surely I would remember this behavior, since I change networks several times a day. \]

If you start X on one network (to be specific, wireless with a 10.0.1.xx address), then move to a different network (ethernet on a different network), the xauth keys do not get updated.

E.g.:

\#\#\# The X server had already been launched on the 10. network, the machine put to sleep, then woken up on the "work" network. xauth shows a mix of keys:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xauth list
    idiotbox.work.edu/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  fb38dff6c5ed95e341cb6f8b72d61b8b
    Idiotbox.home/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7
    10.0.1.24:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7

\#\#\# X clients cannot connect:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xterm
    Xlib: connection to "/tmp/launch-ZSJaBH/:0" refused by server
    Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
    xterm Xt error: Can't open display: /tmp/launch-ZSJaBH/:0

\#\#\# Remove the suspect key:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xauth remove idiotbox.work.edu/unix:0

\#\#\# X clients get the expected change in response:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xterm
    Xlib: connection to "/tmp/launch-ZSJaBH/:0" refused by server
    Xlib: No protocol specified

    xterm Xt error: Can't open display: /tmp/launch-ZSJaBH/:0

\#\#\# Add a plausibly correct key:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xauth add idiotbox.work.edu/unix:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7
    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xauth list
    Idiotbox.home/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7
    10.0.1.24:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7
    idiotbox.work.edu/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  450ea9d58e5ced4cdc53a71cd1acbbd7

\#\#\# And clients now work...

> I'll note that adding keys for `127.0.0.1/unix:0` or `localhost/unix:0` instead of `idiotbox.work.edu/unix:0` did not work, but adding `:0` did.

Oh, in the system.log, these show up with AUDIT lines:

Jul 9 12:17:45 idiotbox org.x.startx\[198\]: AllocNewConnection: client index = 1, socket fd = 1
Jul 9 12:17:45 idiotbox org.x.startx\[198\]: AUDIT: Wed Jul 9 12:17:45 2008: 271 X: client 1 rejected from local host (uid 502)
Jul 9 12:18:00 idiotbox org.x.startx\[198\]: AllocNewConnection: client index = 1, socket fd = 1

I think this should be fixed in 2.3.0-rc6... Please let me know.

This is really a feature request and not a bug. I'm going to put this in "later, once the big bugs get taken care of" category.

BTW, I'm surprised you don't have your &lt;hostname&gt;.local in xauth list:

eg for me:
tifa.local/unix:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 648b679978d6d70d20c0b008e53840e9
tifa.local:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 648b679978d6d70d20c0b008e53840e9
10.0.10.3:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 648b679978d6d70d20c0b008e53840e9
172.16.22.1:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 648b679978d6d70d20c0b008e53840e9
172.16.128.1:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 648b679978d6d70d20c0b008e53840e9

---

So if I change network interfaces, it "just works" for me because tifa.local is always referencing my box.

> \[ Sorry for not responding sooner: I have been offline. \]

I tried 2.3.0-rc7, and it works beautifully. Basically, a `localhost:1` key is created no matter what network I start from, and it never goes away. And strange keys no longer come and go. Granted, the `localhost:1` key always appears in pairs, and the only other key is the `hostname/unix:1` appropriate to when the server was started. But I think that's fine; it certainly is for my situation. E.g. after I started the server at work then came home, I see:

    idiotbox:~ cloomis$ xauth list
    idiotbox.work.edu/unix:1  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  2cb07ad22efd42d63918bca943517e77
    localhost:1  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  2cb07ad22efd42d63918bca943517e77
    localhost:1  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  2cb07ad22efd42d63918bca943517e77

Besides that improvement, some other, slightly different and harder for me to duplicate, `Xlib: connection to "/tmp/launch-ZSJaBH/:0" refused by server` errors are also gone with 2.3.0-rc7.

Thanks!
