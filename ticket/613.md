The application X11 could not be opened.
========================================


I keep on getting this error and can't get past it.

An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Cannot open log file "/Users/cody/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log"
"

Click Quit to quit X11. Click Report to see more details or send a report to Apple.

Ok, well why can't it edit that file? Do you have a permissions problem?

That file isn't even there. I don't have a "Logs" folder at all.

Right, so you need to figure out why that is... How are your ~/Library permissions?

drwxr-xr-x+

Used ls -ld ~/Library/

Did you figure out the problem? I'd like to fix this in the next release. Does ~/Library/Logs exist? Does ~/Library/Logs/X11 exist? What are their permissions? If they don't exist, try creating them. Maybe it's a problem with the server creating those directories.
