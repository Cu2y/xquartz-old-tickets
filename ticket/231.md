Wrong font size in GUI, DPI mismatch
====================================


Starting from XQuartz version 2.3.2, GUI fonts in X11 applications are sensibly larger; I know this is an intended behaviour, but they actually appear to be larger than due, even when setting the correct DPI.

The attached screenshots were taken on a 13" MacBook (white, late 2007) running Leopard (10.5.6, XQuartz 2.3.2.1 has been installed after the latest Apple update), where the correct DPI appears to be 112 according to Adobe Reader (and a quick calculation indeed returns 113.49), after setting 112 for the dpi setting in org.x.X11.plist.

The first screenshot shows a direct comparison between system menus (right) and GIMP menus (left); the latter are clearly using a larger font, making the menus unusually big.
GIMP is version 2.6.4 from the "GIMP on OS X" project.

The second one shows Inkscape 0.46. The menus are sensibly bigger than system ones again, and you can also see that such a large font makes the status bar too small to show the complete help text.

I did some testing, and 89 DPI seems to be a value which makes X11 GUI fonts more or less equivalent to system ones here. But, according to what I've read, font size should be ok at 112 DPI instead.

Sorry, maybe "visibly" would have been a better choice than "sensibly":

"...GUI fonts in X11 applications are **visibly** larger..."

"...The menus are **visibly** bigger than system ones again..."

Just to be clear.

Larger than the system ones possibly, but then you should tweak that in your toolkit. It's not an issue at the server level.
