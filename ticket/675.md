No documentation for uninstallation
===================================


I would like to uninstall XQuartz 2.7.4 on a Mac OS X 10.8.2 system but I do not know what the XQuartz installer did. Besides the .app file in the Applications Utilities folder, there was also a new opt directory at the root level. What else did the installer create/change (I know I had to log out and then back in as part of the installation directions)? An uninstall guide would be greatly appreciated and I noticed from a Bing search that others have had this question but have not really known what to do. I think a link on <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/> to a page with uninstall directions would be very helpful. Thank you in advance.

Thank you for the information. Based on using lsbom, the uninstall instructions need to be modified for Mountain Lion and I have provided them immediately below this line.

Uninstall Steps for Mountain Lion 10.8.2

1.  launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist
2.  sudo rm -rf /opt/X11\* /Library/Launch\*/org.macosforge.xquartz.\* /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app /private/etc/\*paths.d/\*XQuartz
3.  sudo pkgutil --forget org.macosforge.xquartz.pkg

Please add this as a Q and A to ​<https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ> .
