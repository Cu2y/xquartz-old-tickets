X11 V 2.3.2 via Screen Sharing Shift Control Alt works
======================================================


Just for information - (refer Ticket 172), I installed 2.3.2 with no changes to Mac software including ScreenSaver, and the Control/Shift now works using ScreenSaver. So for example we can use xemacs remotely.

So for us ScreenSaver and Control/Shift characters work in 2.3.0 and 2.3.2, and not in 2.3.1.
So we are happy ScreenSaver users again,

thanks barry

You really shouldn't create a new bug report just to send a message.

Yes, I added a workaround for the ScreenSharing (not ScreenSaver) bug.
