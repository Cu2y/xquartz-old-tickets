triggers the discrete GPU
=========================


Currently using a MacBook Pro (the "Retina" version) and XQuartz seems to always trigger the discrete GPU when I use it (usually ssh). It reduces battery life by ~20%. A fix would be really nice. Thank you.

This would be an issue with CoreGraphics. Please file a radar.

This should be fixed in 2.7.5\_rc1 when it is released.

I have a MacBookPro6,2 running OS X 10.8.3 (12D68), and this is still a problem for me even when running 2.7.5\_rc1.

Yes, I forgot to commit the change in rc1. It'll be in the next release.
