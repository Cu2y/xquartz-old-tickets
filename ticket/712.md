There's A Problem That Is Supposed To Be On The Process List But It's Not
=========================================================================


I was following a tutorial, and it said that there was supposed to be a program on the process list. It's not, and I even downloaded the exe version of it.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

There's nothing here to go on. There's nothing to even indicate that X11 is in any way involved with the problem you are having.
