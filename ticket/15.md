new Xquartz man page in X11-2.1.0.pkg has some small problems
=============================================================


3 problems in/usr/X11/man/man1/Xquartz.1:

1.  No copyright notice

<!-- -->

1.  First line is .TH XQUARTZ 1 <span class="underline">vendorversion</span>

This leads to a footer line

> <span class="underline">vendorversion</span> XQUARTZ(1)

1.  The section SEE ALSO

> X(<span class="underline">miscmansuffix</span>), XFree86(1), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xinit(1)

refers to 3 non-existing man pages (X, XFree86, xinit)

I fixed it to be pre-processed correctly. It still needs a thorough edit though
