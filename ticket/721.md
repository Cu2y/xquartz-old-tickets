Crash in \_CreateKeyboardInputSourcesArray
==========================================


Every couple of days, XQuartz crashes with the same backtrace, as attached.

This has been a persistent bug in XQuartz for the past 1-2 years, across
Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion.

I am using an USB keyboard (and USB trackball). I'd be happy to help
track this down further, if I get instructions.

It does look similar to [\#⁠166](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/166), but this one most definitely has not been fixed.

That doesn't look like an X11-specific bug. You're deep inside HIToolbox.

This is also not [\#⁠166](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/166) which was because we were syncing the keyboard layout on a different thread.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

No other reports. Can you try running with guard malloc enabled?
