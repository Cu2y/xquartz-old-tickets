focus-related regression with XQuartz 2.7.3
===========================================


ever since upgrading from 2.7.2 to 2.7.3, i now see X11.app stop bringing it's windows to the foreground when switching back to it. this doesn't happen immediately. if i restart X11.app, things work for a while, but then eventually break. once broken, the bad behavior is reproducible every time. i only run one X application (Visual SlickEdit). using the &lt;CMD&gt;-2 keyboard shortcut will bring the window back to the foreground. sometimes, like right now, that won't even work and i'll need to minimize the window and i'll need to use Window -&gt; Bring All to Front to get it to come back up.

another data point: exiting and restarting the X application is another way to work around the problem (presumably temporarily)

Can you please take a screen capture of the issue happening using Quick Time?

Does it happen on Lion?

i can't easily test under Lion, but even i could, i don't have a reproducible test case :( it just eventually starts happening.

Weird. Putting it on the schedule to look at in 2.7.5, but without more data, it will be difficult.

i'm happy to collect whatever data you want as it happens often enough that it shouldn't be difficult :)

i haven't seen the issue since upgrading the OS from 10.9. i'd be surprised if the underlying bug weren't still there, but i'm thrilled that it's no longer manifesting in the way it was. i'm currently using XQuartz 2.7.5 with OSX 10.9.2.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
