XQuartz does not work well with multiple monitors on OS X 10.9 Mavericks
========================================================================


I recently upgraded from OS X 10.8 to 10.9 and noticed that XQuartz does not work well at all with multiple monitors on 10.9. It is impossible to move an X11 window from one screen to another; if one attempts to do that, the window ends up in an invisible area of the original screen from which it seems impossible to get it back. When activating the Mission Control feature that shows all my X11 features, it still shows up on the original screen.

Some windows (e.g. Inkscape dialogs) even open on that invisible area, which makes them totally unusable. I think this severely impacts the usability of X11 applications.

To reproduce:

-   Plug in a second screen
-   Open an X11 window
-   If you cannot see the X11 window but do see it in the Window menu or through Mission Control, you've already reproduced the bug
-   If you can see it, move it to the other screen by dragging its title bar there. The result will be, as soon as you stop dragging when 0% of the window is on the original screen, that you cannot get it back. The expected result is that it shows up on the other screen.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

This is something that must be fixed by an OS update, not through XQuartz.

This has been a long-term bug with XQuartz, and should not be reported to apple. The window manager in XQuartz needs to be smarter and respond appropriately when the title bar of a window gets moved off of the visible area of a display or when displays are changed dynamically such as when a user opens system preferences and moves a display. If a user attempts to move a window from one display to another, XQuartz should do the right thing regardless of the mode settings in mission control. This bug needs to be reopened and assigned to somebody who has the time to fix these longstanding usability problems. Apple is not about to change the say multiple monitor support works just to make XQuartz users happy.

As mentioned above, this is not something that can be fixed in XQuartz. It is a bug in the OS.

This is not a "long-term bug with XQuartz" ... this is a well understood change in CoreGraphics between Mountain Lion and Mavericks which cannot be worked around in XQuartz.

If you want to complete the work of XtoQ which removes the reliance on libXplugin (and thus would eliminate this class of bugs), be my guest. I'd be happy to point you in the right direction and assign relevant bugs to you. Suggesting that bugs be "assigned to somebody who has the time" is quite futile unless you know someone who is willing to work on it.
