can't open dlight on Yosemite 10.10 using XQuartz 2.7.7
=======================================================


hi

I did uninstall and reinstall xquartz 2.7.7 but I can't open the soft.

/Applications/DLight.app/Contents/Resources/DLight

Tk\_Init failed: couldn't connect to display "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.0LPoZyulIO/org.macosforge.xquartz:0"

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Behaves Correctly*

It looks like DLight.app has its own version of libxcb which is too old. Please contact the DLight developers.
