Again, keyboard mapping is broken by NX
=======================================


Previous bug thread:
<http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/471>

I've exactly the same behavior, and below is result asked by jeremyhu@ before:

    1) Run xterm
    2) Type in the xterm ... is it broken?
    No, it works, result is attached.
    3) Run NX
    4) Type in NX ... assuming broken...
    It is broken.
    5) Go back to your xterm
    6) Type in xterm ... is it broken?
    Result is the same as step (2)

Below is result of "xmodmap -pke" for step (2) and (6):

-   **Type** changed from *crash* to *usability*
-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

Thanks.

Based on the information given, this sounds like a bug in NX. Other applications are printing the correct characters, which means that NX is getting the correct keycodes and keysyms. They're just doing something different with them. Please report this to the NX developers. I am more than happy to work with them to resolve the issue, but since other applications work and NX is 3rd party, I can't do anything at this point.

Based on the information given, the X11 provided by Apple (2.3.6) and the XQuartz downloadable from Macosforge (2.6.3) do something differently, because I see correct behavior with 2.3.6 but not 2.6.3 and I see the X server as the only variable here. I volunteer to provide more information if someone points me to the right direction.

So, you mean I need to downgrade my xserver? Would you share me a link to download?

At the same time, I am thinking about file a bug to NX, but can't find the entry on doing this... Anyone can help?

See <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/515>

I simply returned to using the X11 server provided by Apple with 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.

With Nomachine I think I'd start from here: <http://www.nomachine.com/tr/index.php>

But assuming that the problem is in their protocol design, I see it quite much trouble for them to start fixing the issue. I'd simply assume that they will recommend using the X11 server provided by Apple. But at least you can try giving them your 2 cents.
