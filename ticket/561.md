Xquartz x11\_server server crash whithin root account
=====================================================


Hi,
Since Xquartz version 2.7.x .. until 2.7.2 beta4, the application crashes when running within the root account.
Problem solved by downgrading to version 2.6.3. but it will be nice to have the newest version running within the root account.

for example see the lines or atached crash files:

.. after 8 seconds .. similar stuff.

Cheers.

-   **Resolution** changed from to *behaves correctly*

Based on your crash log, this assertion is failing:

            char *home = getenv("HOME");
            assert(home);

You should not be running this as root. Why are you trying to run as root? Please followup on the users mailing list.
