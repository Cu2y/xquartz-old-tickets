fullscreen on one screen of a multimonitor system
=================================================


It would be nice to setup/start X11
in fullscreen mode only one one screen
of a multi-monitor system.

to mention an example:
The Application RemoteDesktopClient can be set up
in the preferences in such a way, that one can
choose the resolution of the window/screen, and in
which Screen it should appear (Main Display / Secondary
Display)

Thanx..

Özkan

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
