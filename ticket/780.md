XQuartz does not have it's own window
=====================================


I am unable to get XQuartz to load in its own window. The window I do have is small, and I need it to be able to resize it. It also by default positions itself in the upper right corner. Going Applications -&gt; Terminal opens a new window, but it is directly on top of the window that is already open, and cannot be resized or moved.
