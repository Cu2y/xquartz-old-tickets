glutHideWindow creates errors: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetSurfaceBounds
===========================================================================


A simple test program which creates a window with glutCreateWindow() creates a set of errors when calling glutHideWindow(). Seems to be related to ticket [\#⁠282](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/282). This happens on the Mac OS X standard X11 installation as well:

    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowBounds
    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetSurfaceBounds
    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSBindSurface: Invalid window 0x130b
    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSBindSurface: Invalid window 0x130b
    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSBindSurface: Invalid window 0x130b
    Wed Aug 25 00:09:44 vangogh xtest[45786] <Error>: unknown error code: invalid drawable

This bug does NOT happen on my Ubuntu 9.10 i386/32bit machines.

My test program is attached.
