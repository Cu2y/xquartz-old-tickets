XQuartz hangs and always restarts when Force-Quit
=================================================


Hi,

I am trying to run Wireshark under Mountain Lion on a "Retina"-MBP.

However, when I start Wireshark, it just opens a single menu and no window. I cannot select anything from the menu (the color ball appears). I can only Force-Quit Wireshark.

XQuartz itself also doesn't react to anything but Force-Quit.
After quitting, it restarts automatically. I can then, for example, open the Preferences but not start xterm. Quitting also doesn't work, I have to Force-Quit again.

When I start XQuartz by itself, it just keeps "hopping" in the Dock with nothing happening.

I already reinstalled XQuartz and Wireshark and removed the .wireshark(-etc) directories but nothing changed.

Please help, I really need to be able to run Wireshark!

Thanks!

I added the requested files. I'm running in the exact same situation.

Just for the record, you could of course force the quit from a terminal using:

prep X11 | xargs kill -9

My bad, it will still restart after some seconds...
