PseudoColor: windows do not refresh upon updates to global colormap
===================================================================


In 256 colormap mode, changes to the global 256 entry colormap are not "pushed" to windows using that map. The change \*is\* reflected in the next manual update by the windows. It may be that a refresh event is not sent. This worked in Tiger X11.

Replying to [mattspam@…](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/212):

> In 256 colormap mode, changes to the global 256 entry colormap are not "pushed" to windows using that map. The change \*is\* reflected in the next manual update by the windows. It may be that a refresh event is not sent. This worked in Tiger X11.

I was able to get some source code for the problem application. The function in question is XStoreColors(). According to the Apple man page, "The XStoreColors function changes the colormap entries of the pixel values specified in the pixel members of the XColor structures...If the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the changes are visible immediately..."
