Add /etc/manpaths.d/40-XQuartz to set MANPATH
=============================================


I just installed XQuartz 2.7.7.
No man pages are available for Xquartz, or Xorg. The X11 "Help" menu item displays an error page.

I used "find" to locate /opt/X11/share/man/man1/Xserver.1, but the dir is not added to manpath.

So I can't reproduce your issue in 2.7.8 rc2.
