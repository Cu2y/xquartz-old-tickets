Cannot use GLSL shaders in XQuartz
==================================


glxinfo shows that the following extensions are supported:

GL\_ARB\_shader\_objects
GL\_ARB\_vertex\_shader
GL\_ARB\_fragment\_shader

but it is not possible to get the function pointers of the shader functions.

e.g.: `glXGetProcAddress((const GLubyte*)"glCreateProgramObjectARB")` returns NULL

(same for glCreateShaderObjectARB, glShaderSourceARB, glCompileShaderARB, glAttachObjectARB, glLinkProgramARB, etc.)

This is using both XQuartz 2.3.1 and 2.3.2\_rc4.

This is a bug in the old libGL. It's only able to provide function pointers for the known glapi. In this case the symbol should come from the Mac OpenGL framework, and not the glapi code in the X11 libGL. I can work around it, if needed in the old libGL. In the new libGL (available as part of the 2.4.0 alphas) it has been resolved by using dlsym(). In addition the new libGL should have the glCreateProgramObjectARB and related ARB extensions builtin.

Tom, can you try 2.4.0\_alpha2: <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads>

Is this still an issue in 2.3.3\_beta1?
