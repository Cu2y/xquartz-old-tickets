XServer connection reset for 2.6.3/Lion/Multi Screen
====================================================


When I run a ssh remote session on a solaris station on my multi-screen environment (MacOS 10.7), the server blinks for a second after 5min. working. After that I cannot launch any X clients from by ssh session, I get the message

XIO: fatal IO error 131 (Connection reset by peer) on X server "localhost:10.0"

> after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.

This did not happen on MacOS 10.6.

You say you can't launch any, but what about existing connections? If you ssh to your solaris box from your mac and open an xterm, does it stay functional after this event?
