Drawing error with windows larger than one display. (Lion)
==========================================================


I have three displays on this machine, if I create or resize a window such that it is wider than one of them, any portion that is off the primary display is black.
Specifically I have two 30" cinema's displays (2560x1600), one on either side of a 27" iMac (2560x1440), and the window that exhibits the issue is 3840x1024.

This is on Lion (10.7) and occurs with both the supplied X and the version 2.6.3 that I just installed from here. I have confirmed that the X-Server now identifies it self as "XQuartz 2.6.3 (xorg-server 1.10.3)".

-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Expected*
-   **Milestone** set to *OSX*

As this is reportedly new to Lion, I highly doubt this is an X11 bug.

Please open a bug report at <http://bugreport.apple.com>, and let me know the bug number, so I can follow it up inside Apple.

Also be sure to include your system profile. Does this only happen with large windows, or does it happen if you straddle a small window across the two?

What video card do you have?
