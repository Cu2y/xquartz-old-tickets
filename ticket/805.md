In OS X Mavericks, X Apps Dragged To Extended Desktop External Display Disappear
================================================================================


XQuartz 2.7.4 has been operating flawlessly with OS X Mountain (10.8.4, 10.8.5), but I upgraded to Mavericks last night and discovered today that X11 fowarded GUIs opened on my primary MBP Retina display disappear when dragged to an external display in extended desktop mode. GUIs opened locally without X do properly display on external displays when dragged to them. So, this definitely appears to be a bug with XQuartz in Mavericks, but NOT Mountain Lion. I noticed that the Mavericks install replaced my sshd\_config with a new one which had X11Forwarding commented out. I did set that back to "X11Forwarding = yes" and I also tried my old sshd\_config, but neither corrected this issue.

I use my Mac for my electrical engineering job so getting this to work properly is pretty critical for me. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!
