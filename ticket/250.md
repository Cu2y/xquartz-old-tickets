Display Unusuable on iMac7,1 with ATI Radeon 2600HD GPU
=======================================================


Applications which use hardware acceleration with the ATI 2600HD GPU give unusable displays with very high levels of flashing and flickering. On an nVIDIA 9400M GPU the applications run perfectly. Example applications are Schrodinger Maestro and GDIS.
