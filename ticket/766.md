glXMakeCurrent with Motif sometimes puts XQuartz in faulty state (error: xp\_attach\_gl\_context returned: 2)
=============================================================================================================


I'm working on a program that frequently creates Motif windows, draws to them with OpenGL, and later destroys them. On some OSX systems, this will work perfectly for a while, and then randomly begins failing with roughly 50% probability. It appears that a faulty state is somehow being produced in XQuartz, which persists for the remainder of its lifetime. I've made a couple programs (See causes\_fault.c and fault\_sensitive.c, attached) to reproduce the problem. Here is what I observe using them:

-   Run fault\_sensitive (./fault\_sensitive 10000)
    -   Works correctly over any number of iterations
-   Run causes\_fault (./causes\_fault 10000)
    -   Works correctly for anywhere from 1 to ~1000 iterations
    -   Observe a 5-second pause in execution during the call to glXMakeCurrent
    -   Additional iterations succeed with only around 50% probability each
    -   Iteration fails during its call to glXMakeCurrent; the default X error handler prints a message and exits the program. (See causes\_fault\_output.txt, attached.)
-   Run fault\_sensitive or causes\_fault
    -   Iterations succeed with around 50% probability
    -   Iterations fail during their call to glXMakeCurrent just as before
-   Quit XQuartz
-   Back to step 1

It appears that the faulty state is produced during that 5-second pause. I've captured a spindump (See causes\_fault\_spindump.txt, attached) that shows the following stack during those five seconds:

      808 start + 1 (libdyld.dylib) [0x7fff897007e1]
        610 main + 577 (causes_fault) [0x1006ddd81]
          609 MakeContextCurrent + 272 (libGL.1.dylib) [0x1006e7fd3]
            609 applegl_bind_context + 61 (libGL.1.dylib) [0x1006eafc9]
              559 apple_glx_make_current_context + 456 (libGL.1.dylib) [0x1006e245a]
                555 apple_glx_surface_create + 120 (libGL.1.dylib) [0x1006e3e11]
                  555 XAppleDRICreateSurface + 165 (libGL.1.dylib) [0x1006e4e56]
                    554 _XReply + 215 (libX11.6.dylib) [0x1007856fc]
                      554 xcb_wait_for_reply + 103 (libxcb.1.dylib) [0x100d3247b]
                        554 wait_for_reply + 215 (libxcb.1.dylib) [0x100d32569]
                          554 __select + 10 (libsystem_kernel.dylib) [0x7fff8ab39322]
                           *554 ??? (mach_kernel + 3581120) [0xffffff800056a4c0]

I have observed this problem on two Intel iMacs, running OSX 10.8.0 and 10.8.3. I have observed the problem using XQuartz 2.7.3, 2.7.4, and 2.7.5\_rc2.

I would be happy to provide additional information. An effective workaround would also be greatly appreciated.

The behavior of this bug appears to have changed somewhat in OSX 10.9. Rather than XQuartz invisibly suffering the fault and then the application later failing on glXMakeCurrent, X11 just crashes instead. Frequency of the problem appears to be unchanged. The auto-generated crash report is attached. I've also observed a couple of machines that seem to never fail in this way- I have no idea why.

Out of curiosity, I performed a deeper inspection of the stack at the point of the crash (see the stack for thread 10 in the attached crash report). The 'rect' argument of CGContextClearRect() is \[0.0, 0.0, (window width), 22.0\]- the exact size of the window's title bar.

-   **Summary** changed from *glXMakeCurrent with Motif sometimes puts XQuartz in faulty state* to *glXMakeCurrent with Motif sometimes puts XQuartz in faulty state (error: xp\_attach\_gl\_context returned: 2)*

I ran the server with guardmalloc enabled:

    $ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin 

I then ran your attached causes\_fault.c (with 10000 as an argument), and the server never crashed.

xp\_attach\_gl\_context returns 2 only when the passed cgl\_ctx is NULL

I wonder if this was fallout from the heap corruption that was fixed in :

Do you use MacPorts? The mesa port in MacPorts has that fix, and it will also be in 2.7.7\_beta2. Can you report back if the issue persists for you?

            apple_glx_surface.c:69   surface_make_current(140735098945920): surface_make_current: ac->context_obj 0x7fc6a400e000 s->surface_id 13
        error: xp_attach_gl_context returned: 2

So xp\_attach\_gl\_context(0x7fc6a400e000, 13) was called. The context was not NULL. We also return 2 if the underlying CGLSetSurface() returns ANY error =/

If the issue persists with the new mesa, I can build you a libXplugin with more debugging to print out what the actual error from CGLSetSurface() is.

Please report back if you are still having issues. Note that 2.7.8\_beta2 has an even newer libGL.

I can't reproduce an issue with the attached files in 2.7.8\_beta2, so closing.
