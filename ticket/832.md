Mavericks: window created with bar behind menu bar
==================================================


When a new xmgrace window is created, it has always spawned in the top left most corner of the secondary window.
This was annoying before, but Maverick places a menu bar over the window bar making it unmovable.

Should be fixed in 2.7.7\_beta2 when it is released.

FWIW, this has been pulled into master and server-1.15-branch as well

Unfortunately, I am using 2.7.7 (final release) with OS X 10.9.4 and still occasionally experiencing this on my second display. In case it is at all relevant, the windows I open are over an ssh connection with X11 forwarding. Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.

Nothing changed between rc2 and the final release.

Please attach ~/Library/Logs/X11/org.macosforge.xquartz.log

OK, will attach that log when I see it happen again.

I did not mean to imply that I expected resolution of the issue to occur between rc2 and final; I expected to see resolution between 2.7.6 and 2.7.7, but perhaps it was my mistake not to try the rc's to confirm before final release that I still saw the problem. Sorry.

For the log I just attached, here's the sequence:

I ran gvim over an ssh connection.
XQuartz automatically started, creating the attached log file.
The gvim window appeared on my primary display.
I then ran another program over the ssh connection which was to open X11 windows.
Those windows opened on my secondary display in the top left, with their title bars underneath the OS X menu bar.
I saw no modification of the XQuartz log upon the opening of these second windows.

This second program does intentionally put the X11 window's top left coordinates as a fixed number of pixels away from the top left corner of what it thinks is the screen, whatever defines that top left corner (my displays are arranged such that my primary display is to the right of my secondary display). But that top left corner seems to be under the menu bar on the second display. I can even take my gvim window from my primary display, drag it to my second display, and slide it up underneath the menu bar on the second display (the primary display's menu bar is respected).

Hope that helps,
-Gene

    [4185092.399] x: 1680, y: 22, w: 1680, h: 1028
    [4185092.399] x: 0, y: 0, w: 1680, h: 1050

It looks like you have two 1680x1050 monitors side by side. The one on the right has a menubar, and the one on the left does not. Is that not the case?

Have you toggled the "Displays have separate Spaces" option in System Preference -&gt; Mission Control without logging out? Toggling that requires a logout to take effect. We make our decision based on the current state of that toggle (not the state that it was at when you logged in last), so if you change it and forget to logout, you will have an invalid state.

Yes, I do have two 1680x1050 displays side-by-side, with the one on the right being the primary display.

I believe your hypothesis about the separate spaces is correct. I hadn't logged out in months! I got the chance to log out and back in a couple times this morning and found the desired behavior: no separate spaces leads to no menu bar on the second display, thus no problem; separate spaces gives a menu bar which is now respected.

So all appears to be well and understood, and I've no problem with you re-closing the ticket. Thanks for your prompt assistance, Jeremy.

This bug followed Yosemite back from hell. If there were a menu item or hotkey to move or arrange windows then it would mitigate these glitches. When such things used to happen on KDE I could just press Alt-F3 and the window would move to my mouse.
