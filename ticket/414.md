XTEST extension no longer available
===================================


Formerly, XQuartz used the internal default:

> "enable\_test\_extensions" = 1;

to enable various extensions, including XTEST. The current version no longer responds to this setting:

> 'execution error: Error: XTEST extension unavailable'

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.5.1*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *worksforme*

works for me.

I just verified on 2.5.1\_rc1 on Leoaprd:

       defaults write org.x.X11 enable_test_extensions -bool yes 

On SL, the above will only setup X11.app. To modify XQuartz.app, you'll need to do:

       defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_test_extensions -bool yes

Thanks, XTEST works for me now using the 2nd defaults call.
