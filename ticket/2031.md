fc-cache launches on each startup and pegs the CPU for five minutes
===================================================================


I'm running 2.7.8\_beta1 on 10.6.8. Each time I start XQuartz fc-cache runs for about five minutes and spikes the CPU at 100%. This has been occurred in past versions, as well. I've attached a spindump.

I suggest you report this to fontconfig develoers. There have been issues with caching in recent releases. I thought it was addressed, but I guess not.
