X11 menu item triggers "you need to install X11"
================================================


After upgrading to Mavericks I have begun to notice a problem in which use of the items on the "Applications" menu (xterm, xman, xlogo) bring up a dialog with a message such as the following:

> To open "xterm," you need to install X11. Would you like to install X11 now?

Cancel and Continue buttons are provided; Continue simply takes the user to the Apple support page for MacOSForge: <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293>

Clearly, this is occurring because of some failed check for the installation state. I say "clearly" as X11 is already running, and therefore must be installed. X11 exhibits no problems when being started from the Dock, nor as a login process (this being the means by which I normally start it).

Additionally, all of the X applications, such as xterm, work perfectly when started via the command line.

The only issue seems to be the check for installation state performed by whatever action is taken by the menu item itself to invoke an X application such as xterm.

I have contacted Apple regarding this issue, and while they are unable to do anything about it, the case number they have opened for this problem is case: 528 763 077

As a workaround, deinstalling and reinstalling XQuartz does solve this problem

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

This was an issue with the OS X 10.9 installer re-installing the trap for X11 despite XQuartz being installed. Simply reinstalling (no uninstall needed) is sufficient to work around the issue. No need to file a radar with Apple, I've already taken care of that.
