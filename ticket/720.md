Zero key does not work
======================


For some reason, the zero (0) key does not work in XQuartz. This has been true since at least Snow Leopard, on through Mountain Lion. I am using a dvorak keyboard layout, but switching to US doesn't make any difference.

The key doesn't work, regardless of whether I use modifiers or not (in other words, neither zero nor closing-parenthesis work). It works fine outside of XQuartz.

Attached is the output of xmodmap -pke. I notice that there is no mapping for 0 anywhere.

Without a 0 key, it's pretty much unusable, and has been for ages.

What's the output of 'xinput test &lt;\#&gt;' when you press the 0 key (where \# is the entry on 'xinput list' that corresponds to the keyboard.

What about 'xev'?

Ok, so it looks like your 0-key is sending keycode 37 (which is the same keycode as qwerty 0).

I don't know why keycode 37 would be mapped to Control\_L though. Do you have a ~/.Xmodmap file? There is definitely something about your configuration that is the problem. For example, we do not set all the audio keycodes (like you have for 144), so you're setting those yourself somewhere. My guess is you're accidentally setting keycode 37 in the same place.

You can also try creating a fresh user account. My guess is that it should work fine with that account. If it doesn't, you probably have a global Xmodmap file present at /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

Aha! I forgot about my ancient ~/.Xmodmap... strange that keycode 37, which seems to be caps lock on every other system, maps to 0 on this one, but removing that did it. Thanks!
