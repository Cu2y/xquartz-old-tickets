problem after Apple Xcode update
================================


I agreed to Apple update, installed mew Xcode (command line developer tools) and after that X11 application swi-prolog broke. It display just empty screen, but with the right title.
Apple support refused to help. Can you tell me how to go about it?
Thanks Josef Frydl

The install of Xcode is likely unrelated.

Take a spindump.
