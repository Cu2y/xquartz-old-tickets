Can't export display the second time.
=====================================


I noticed this strange error today after running X11 with exporting DISPLAY one time at work without any problems but when I got home and tried to export DISPLAY it didn't work. I tired to kill all X11 process which there were none but I still couldn't get the DISPLAY to export. I finally rebooted and got to export DISPLAY at home. X11 didn't crash.

I'm running Mac OS 10.6.8 on MacBookPro and running X11/XQuartz 2.7.5.

I have no idea what you mean by this.

What do you mean that you "tried to export DISPLAY it didn't work" ?

Can you show me exactly what you did (copy paste from terminal)?

'export DISPLAY' by itself should do absolutely nothing. It's already exported (meaning that it will be in the environment of child processes) by the shell.

If you mean you set it to something (eg: 'export DISPLAY=:0'), then that is expected to fail.

Feel free to re-open this ticket with more information, but I think you'll be better served by asking for support on the mailing list as it doesn't sound like there's a bug here.
