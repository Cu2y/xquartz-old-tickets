Problem using additional display!
=================================


Hi,

I just installed Mavericks in two apple laptops. I am using additional screen. I can move all of my laptop screen stuff to the additional screen except XQuartz window. I am losing the window if I move to the addition screen. I think this is a big bug. Before in my one laptop I had mac osx 10.7.5 and another one 10.5.8 both had XQuartz without any problem.
Please help me out of that.

Not an XQuartz bug. Please check the x11-usrers mailing list archive for discussion.
