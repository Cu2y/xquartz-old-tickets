RandR Support
=============

-   **Priority** changed from *blocker* to *critical*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.1.1 (X11R7.2 - xserver-1.3)*

### From 1.2a8 release notes

"Fake RandR" support -- Tiger's X11.app didn't actually support the RandR extension (which allows display configuration to be changed while the server is running), but it did copy some code that does part of that. I'd like to actually implement support for RandR, but in the mean time I've copied the "fake" code into Xquartz. I haven't yet managed to scrounge up the hardware to test this, so I would appreciate hearing reports about whether this does or does not work.

### In an email from Ben

<http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/xserver.git;a=commitdiff;h=b36f667a34bac249a53d530e04301d3a97f2d180>

"All" we need to do is implement DarwinModeRandRGetInfo and DarwinModeRandRSetConfig, and then undefine FAKE\_RANDR. Easy, right? ;)

When we call DarwinModeRandRInit(), it should enable the extension. (Right now, it fails to initialize the extension in mi/miinitext because the number of Screens for which RandR has been enabled is currently zero.

There are a couple of subtleties here. Specifically, the GetInfo function isn't too hard -- it will just take someone sitting down and figuring out what CoreGraphics calls we need to make to get the info we need to return when that function is called.

The "SetConfig" one is the more dangerous one. If we implement that, then X client apps get to change the global screen resolution !

> Obviously you have put in enough RandR that un/plugging an external monitor gives xdpyinfo the right information about the screen. But I'd like to point out particular bug, which might help clarify where to look further. This is with 2.1.2-rc5 on a MacBook Pro, launched with just the laptop screen (1440x900). Plug in an external monitor configured to 1280x1024, which is displayed to the left of the laptop screen, aligned at the top. xdpyinfo (correctly) shows a single display of 2720x1024. Now launch xev.

> If the right edge of the xev window extends past pixel 1439 (the size of the laptop screen-1, and physically 159 pixels onto the laptop screen), the xev window does not get LeaveWindow events when the mouse is moved off the right hand side. Instead, it keeps getting MotionNotify events as long as the mouse is to the right of the window (i.e. not below the bottom edge of the window. The root window x-coordinates stay clipped to 1439 (the other x coordinate stops changing at that point). Also, no windows can be moved past much that virtual 1440 pixel edge: no mouse x-coordinate can ever exceed it.

> None of this happens if the X server is launched while the second monitor is plugged in, even if the second monitor is then unplugged then re-connected.

I've just started using an external monitor with my laptop part of the time, and I find that X11 behaves pretty oddly when the external is first plugged in. The internal screen is 1440x900, the external 1280x1024, which I configure to be logically above the internal since that matches the physical layout (laptop on lap below monitor on desk). I start with some X11 windows on the internal screen, close the laptop to put it to sleep, plug in the external monitor, open the laptop. The X11 windows move to the external screen, which I gather is expected behavior because it's the "same position" on the new larger virtual screen; though I'd rather that didn't happen. The real problem though is the windows don't function quite right immediately. What I seem to have to do to get everything working again is to bring each window to front using the command-number-key shortcuts. Also I frequently have white rectangles left behind in the external screen's background image. These seem quite persistent --- even sleeping and re-opening the machine doesn't get rid of them.

Curiously, I've not noticed any problems while reversing the process to go back to just the internal screen.

This is with 2.3.1\_rc1 atop 10.5.4

Well I opened a new feature request that was apparently a duplicate of this... I think XQuartz really needs to be able to have X11 apps be able to switch between fullscreen and rootless, as well as be able to change the screen resolutions... this looks like an old ticket, even though rated "minor" its very important to gamers that use Wine. Crossover's build of X11 actually supports this just fine, and works well... but theirs is only designed to work within their product.

bbyer@... said "The "SetConfig" one is the more dangerous one. If we implement that, then X client apps get to change the global screen resolution !"
ok.. and? good, let them change it!! if thats bad for most, maybe make it an option to enable when launching the X server?

Any updates on this? is anyone looking into adding these features, or is it just that most X11 users don't want or need this? I'm dying for this... I've even been trying to build my own Xfree86 builds that do this just fine, but they have some OpenGL issues and such that I can't fix, I'm far from an expert on X11.

I'm glad your gonna throw this in, its cool. I tried using those patches that Jan gave, but for some reason they don't work for me. I eventually got Xquartz to compile with them, but randr still not function... every time I mess with Xquartz code I never seem to be able to get thins working right :-)

I asked Jan for a status update and haven't heard back. If I don't hear back, I'll integrate them as best I can. There are some functionality concerns that I want to address in a way that is more consistent with what CodeWeavers is doing

A very solid start on this has been pushed to my [server-1.9-apple git branch](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver/log/?h=server-1.9-apple)

-   **Status** changed from *assigned* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Basic support is in 2.6.0\_alpha1 ... but you might want the fix from [\#⁠429](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/429) for stability.
