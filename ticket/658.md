GLX failure with VirtualGL
==========================


Whereas the X11 server supplied by Apple with Lion had no problem with VirtualGL, xquartz 2.7.4 gives me the following error:

X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)

> Major opcode of failed request: 149 (GLX)
> Minor opcode of failed request: 21 (X\_GLXGetFBConfigs)
> Value in failed request: 0x1
> Serial number of failed request: 16
> Current serial number in output stream: 16

The command that causes the error is:
vglrun -c proxy glxgears

Running on a CentOS machine to which I have ssh into. (Any other GL request will give the same result)

Please close the ticket. This seems to be a server-side issue of newer VirtualGL versions on linux and not a client side issue with XQuartz.
