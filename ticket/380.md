Cmd-\` hangs X11
================


In the preference pane, de-select "Enable key equivalents under X11" (Input tab) and select "Focus Follows Mouse" (Windows tab). Start 2 or more xterms. Try to cycle from one xterm to another one using Cmd-`.  The focus changes to the next window, but that xterm doesn't accept any input, and focus can't be changed to any other window by moving the mouse, clicking the window, or by using Cmd-`. By using Window-&gt;Cycle Through Windows from the menu bar focus does change, but all the xterms are equally unusable. New xterms can be started using Applications-&gt;Terminal from the menu bar, but these new windows are not useable either. The preference pane can be used, but the only way to get useful application windows is to quit X11 and restart it.
This behavior was not in the XQuartz release I used before Snow Leopard was used, and not in the Snow Leopard X11 prior to 10.6.3. X11.app in 10.6.3 has the same problem.
