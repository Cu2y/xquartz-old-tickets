Provide full resolution to clients when running on retina display or high dpi screens
=====================================================================================


Currently on retina displays full resolution is not available. I suggest one way this might be made to work:

1) Default behaviour is to pixel double (current behaviour)

2) User can select "High resolution" in preferences

3) Individual X clients can then support high dpi in their own time (many Gnome applications already do)

Limited support seems to be in place already - using xrandr and fullscreen mode, full resolution can be achieved. This suggestion is to make it available for windowed clients too, as an option.
