fontconfig configuration missing ~/Library/Fonts
================================================


Fontconfig does not see fonts installed in the user's home directory.

Please add ~/Library/Fonts to either fonts.conf or 05-osx-fonts.conf, and the ~/.fonts entry can probably be removed.

Also, since /usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts are both listed in fonts.conf, and /usr/X11R6 is just a symbolic link to /usr/X11, fontconfig caches each of the X11 fonts twice. The /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts entry should probably be removed.
