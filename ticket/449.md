xterm scroll-bar border misrendered when resized
================================================


This is related to [\#⁠290](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/290), where parts of the line dividing the scroll-bar and main view area are not rendered correctly. The current release fixes the general rendering bug, but parts of the border are not rendered if the window is resized and partially off-screen, e.g. by using the font-size menu.

To reproduce:
1) place an xterm to extend partially off the bottom of the screen.
2) select the Large or Huge font via the Control-RightClick menu.
3) Move the xterm fully onto the screen.

Result: the part of the border that was offscreen after the resize are absent.

Probably a dupe of [\#⁠412](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/412)

Bug [\#⁠412](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/412) seems to be different, because it report failed drawing of borders in the visible area. This bug only occurs for off-screen areas. However, [\#⁠412](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/412) also mentions that border areas may not get properly reported for dirty-rectangle notification. I assume that there is additional info not mentioned here that leads to the conclusion of being a duplicate, but it would be good to test xterm behavior when [\#⁠412](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/412) gets fixed.
