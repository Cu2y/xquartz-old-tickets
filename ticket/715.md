Color and Sizing Rendering
==========================


I was trying to utilize a software located on my school's server, but when I tried to run the software the window that shows up is pink and doesn't resize accordingly. I am not exactly sure what is going on, but hopefully there is a solution. I have attached a screenshot of how the window looks like. Thanks!
