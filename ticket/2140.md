X11 will not start
==================


I receive the following message when I attempt to start X11:

An error occurred while starting the X11 server: "Could not create lock file in /tmp/.tX0-lock".

After some reading people mentioned problems with the /tmp softlink, so in the terminal I use:

ls -lao /tmp
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root 11 Oct 9 2014 /tmp -&gt; private/tmp

and

ls -lao /private/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@ 6 root 204 Oct 9 2014 .
drwxr-xr-x 34 root 1224 Jun 1 10:24 ..
drwxr-xr-x 94 root 3196 Jun 1 10:24 etc
drwxr-xr-x 2 root 68 Sep 9 2014 tftpboot
drw-rw-rw- 24 root 816 Jun 1 10:25 tmp
drwxr-xr-x 25 root 850 May 8 09:44 var

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

From that, it looks like you messed up your permissions on /private/tmp ... Tons of other software will likely fail as well. You should fix those permissions.

I fixed the permissions with:
sudo chmod 777 /private/tmp

now everything works fine.

Those are not the correct permissions. The correct permissions are 1777
