xterm window does not update text properly
==========================================


The attached gif file demonstrates the problem. Text was not displayed properly until it had been 'wiped' by another window. In the attached picture the 'wipe' window was another xterm window.

The problem occurs only when the color depth was set at 'thousands' of colors. It also occurred when a new user was created and the color depth was set at 'thousands' of colors.

Jeremy requested a bug report to serve as a reminder.

I don't see this on 2.5.1\_beta1 on SnowLeopard. Can you please tell me if this is still a problem for you and if so, how do I get an xterm stuck in this state?
