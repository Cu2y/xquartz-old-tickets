Developer info outdated
=======================


The git urls used in the examples at <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/DeveloperInfo> are outdated. The current repository is accessible instead via <git://people.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver>

Similarly, the link in the sidebar titled "Git Repository" currently goes to a more or less empty page. A working version seems to be <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~jeremyhu/xserver>
