X modifier key state confused after left and right modifier held down at once
=============================================================================


Beginning with 2.3, I started seeing X11's notion of the shift key's state becoming confused. I narrowed it down to a reproducible case:

Start with no keys pressed. Hold down the left shift key, then hold down the right shift key, then release the left, then release the right. X11 now thinks "the shift key" is still down. Typing unmodified alphabetic characters gives their uppercase versions.

This also misbehaves the same way with the control key.

I reproduced this on multiple machines with laptop keyboards and apple's silver extended keyboard. At the same time X11's notion of the modifier is incorrect, Mac OS X is not confused.
