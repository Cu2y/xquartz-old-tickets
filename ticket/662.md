requesting an accumulation buffer fails
=======================================


My application, which is based on Tcl/Tk/togl, fails
to create an OpenGL context with an accumulation
buffer.
The application immediately crashes with
"bus error 10"
If I remove the "-accum true" widget creation option,
the program runs ok (albeit without the functionality
for which it would need the accumulation buffer).

The number of the requested accumulation bits in the
corresponding call to glXChooseVisual() is 1.

For your tests you can download:

regards,
Randolf

Even easier test: run glxinfo. No visual with accumulation buffer bits are listed in 2.7.4. That looks like a regression, it worked before flawlessly.

GLX's Accumulation buffer works with XQuartz 2.7.4 when using it on Mac OS X, 10.7.\[0 1 2 3 4\],
and it does NOT work when using it on OS X 10.7.5+ or 10.8.\*

It seems that this bug is caused by an Apple choice ...

Rafael Navaza.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

See my followup to the mailing list ... you need to start X11 with your discreet graphics enabled.

Sorry, but my machine has only one graphics card (NVidia Geforce 320M), and it does not show any accumulation buffers now (it did before). If MacOSX 10.8 now no longer supports them, this is in contradiction to Apple's documentation: <https://developer.apple.com/graphicsimaging/opengl/capabilities/GLInfo_1080.html> (Legacy). Where would one report this, if it is really not the X-Server swallowing the accumulation buffered visuals?
