X11 crashing on window close
============================


I am trying to use XEvent.type = ClientMessage to detect when a user closes a window. The attached c code is a small program to test this. It runs properly under other X servers I've tried but with XQuartz I get the following error:

XIO: fatal IO error 35 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.OiaccbWRVW/org.macosforge.xquartz:0"

> after 21 requests (16 known processed) with 0 events remaining.

Is this a regression in XQuartz 2.7.8, or has it been an issue in older releases as well?

This was also a problem in older releases. I first noticed it with 2.7.7 and then updated to 2.7.8 but there was no difference in behaviour

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
