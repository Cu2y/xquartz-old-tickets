Leopard 10.5.8 won't run X11 2.4 or 2.3.3.2 with user login
===========================================================


I've tried to run X11 and Inkscape unsuccessfully. Support at Inkscape narrowed it down to this:

3/12/10 12:06:14 PM org.x.startx\[92300\] xauth: creating new authority file /Users/adrea's computer/.serverauth.92300 \\
3/12/10 12:06:14 PM org.x.startx\[92300\] /usr/X11/bin/startx: eval: line 288: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \` *\\
3/12/10 12:06:14 PM org.x.startx\[92300\] /usr/X11/bin/startx: eval: line 289: syntax error: unexpected end of file \\
*

That's a problem with the name of your user account which apparently
prevents X11 itself from starting, not an issue related to Inkscape: The
space and single-quote are likely making something in
/usr/X11/bin/startx fail.

What do I need to do to fix this? I don't know how to program, but I'm very good at follow step-by-step directs so long as every step is there.

This will be addressed in 2.5.0

For your own sake, I recommend you change your $HOME to not contain spaces nor single quotes.
