Maverick then Inkscape fails Got XQuartz, Inkscaped worked once but now fails
=============================================================================


There seems to be some problem with Inkscape, or possibly with XQuartz x-11 for my newly installed Mac OS "Maverick." I got it to work well enough to access an old file, edit it, and save it. Then following day tried to double-click on the same file's icon. Nothing seemed to happen after Inkscape came up. Then I couldn't find Inkscape on the screen, just the icon in the gutter. Restarted computer, opened Inkscape, made a simple change in a new image file. Then tried to open the old file. Nothing happened for a long time.

I have now deleted Inkscape and XQuartz and will try again.

Continues to fail after reinstalling XQuartz and Inkscape.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

This is a problem with Inkscape. X11 is just the window server.
