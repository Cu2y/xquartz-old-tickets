GLhandleARB conflict with OpenGL.framework
==========================================


The declaration of GLhandleARB in glext.h in XQuartz 2.7.5 conflicts with OpenGL.framework. glext.h on OpenGL.org solves this problem by adding a test like this

    #ifdef __APPLE__
    typedef void *GLhandleARB;
    #else
    typedef unsigned int GLhandleARB;
    #endif
