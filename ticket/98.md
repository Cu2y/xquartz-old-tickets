Switching spaces with spaces view (rather than keyboard) does not focus x11 if it is top in the new space
=========================================================================================================


Switching spaces with the keyboard shortcut always correctly focuses the top application, including X11, but using the overhead view or whatever apple has decided to call it, it works for every application I have except X11.

The real issue is that doing it that way X11 doesn't get focus when switched to, and sometimes doesn't give it up when one switches away, I've done some terrible things accidentally after switching spaces and assuming focus was taken.

Please give me some more info about your system... Are you using 2.2.1? What does X11-&gt;About X11 say?

I think this might be the same issue I noted in the first comment in ticket [\#⁠99](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/99). What I see using 2.2.1 is:

-   create an xterm in space 1

<!-- -->

-   switch to space 2, create another xterm

<!-- -->

-   switch to space 1, click if needed to focus on xterm, type "abc"

<!-- -->

-   switch to space 2

<!-- -->

-   type "def"

<!-- -->

-   nothing happens in space 2

<!-- -->

-   switch back to space 1

<!-- -->

-   see "abcdef" in xterm

I find that this happens in both FFM and click-to-focus mode, and it doesn't matter whether you switch spaces via
control-arrow or the F8 view.

-   **Version** set to *2.2.1 (xserver-1.3)*

I cannot reproduce this based on what you wrote. Can you please be more specific. How are you creating the xterm? Are other applications running?

Hm, I can reproduce it just like that, as a test user with zero customization other than enabling Spaces and dragging X11
into the Dock. Nothing else running (fresh login):

Click on X11 dock icon to launch X11. First xterm opens at upper left of space 1.

Control-rightarrow to get to space 2.

Mouse down on X11 dock icon, pick Applications-&gt;Terminal to launch second xterm in upper left of space 2.

Control-leftarrow.

Click to focus on xterm 1, type "abc".

Control-rightarrow.

Type "def". Nothing visible happens.

Control-leftarrow.

See "abcdef" in xterm 1.

Is 2.6.3 any better in this regard?

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
