XQuartz 2.7.x starts opening and then closes continuously
=========================================================


Ever since 2.6.3, whenever I update to 2.7.x (x = 0, 1, or 2), I cannot open a terminal window by opening XQuartz.app - see summary.

Since I haven't used anything but Terminal, I just Trashed the new app and reinstalled 2.6.3, which works fine on my OS X 10.6.8.

I'm beginning to think there is something more serious wrong with my MacBook 5,2 with an Intel Core duo 2 GHz processor. I am newly registered, and didn't notice any earlier bug reports that seemed similar. I have no idea which component is involved, but "unknown" is not an option for Component.

Please ask for help on the x11-users mailing list. Look at /var/log/system.log for anything suspicious.

2.7.2 launches fine for me on OS X 2.7.2
