Problems starting XQuartz 2.7.4\_rc1 after a BOOT
=================================================


Trying to fix an issue of ROOT, OpenGL and XQuarz 2.6.4 on MacPorts (see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/36189#comment:18>), I installed XQuarz 2.7.4\_rc1 (on Lion 10.7.5 and Xcode 4.5).

When I start an application which needs the X server, for example,

    $ xclock &

the new X server does not automatically start. I have to start it manually from Launchpad, and this starts also an xterm application.

After this, if I quit the X11 (Command-Q), the X server starts automatically for applications requiring it, but after a REBOOT or a BOOT, I have to repeat all the above... :-(

With XQuarz 2.6.4 (Apple?) this did not happen, the X server started automatically each time an application required it..

Searching on the web seems I have all things right:

    $ echo $DISPLAY
    /tmp/launch-weY6cP/org.macosforge.xquartz:0

    $ launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist
    org.macosforge.xquartz.startx: Already loaded

BTW, 2.7.4\_rc1 seems to fix the ROOT issue...

Ciao, Angelo.

Nothing related to startup has changed in a long time.

Please try again and if it reproduces, provide more information, like /var/log/system.log

This night there was an update for 10.7.5 (only 1.5 MB) "...to fix a problem with applications which don't want to start..." and now, after a boot, starting an X application starts also XQuartz as expected... :-)

If this isn't a dream, I would say the problem is fixed... :)

Ciao, Angelo.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Version** set to *2.7.3 (xserver-1.12.4)*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.5*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

The rapid response update had nothing to do with X11.

But since you're not experiencing the issue any more, closing...
