Can't get System Preferences while X11 is in front
==================================================


I just upgraded to 10.5.3 and noticed this.
You cannot select the System Preferences if X11 is the front-most application. If you try it, the console reports:

5/30/08 7:23:14 AM System Preferences\[2147\] Unable to find class: X11Application, exiting
5/30/08 7:23:14 AM com.apple.launchd\[1386\] (\[0x0-0xd90d9\].com.apple.systempreferences\[2147\]) Exited with exit code: 1

Did you reinstall the X11 package after updating to 10.5.3?

Doh! I did not, and that was the problem.
