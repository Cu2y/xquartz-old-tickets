Yosemite and X11
================


I have the most recent version of XQuartz and just began having this issue recently. I'm not certain what info is required. If I launch X11 via the GUI/Dock, it bounces once or twice and then does not run. If I attempt to initiate a session by running xterm from the terminal, I get nothing. I upgraded my Mac from Mavericks to Yosemite. The console log shows the following:

    /opt/X11/bin/xinit: unable to connect to X server: Operation timed out

You're getting ETIMEOUT connecting to the server. It's working fine here. Reboot to make sure you're at a clean state, then launch XQuartz.app from the dock. Then run 'sudo sysdiagnose X11.bin' from a terminal. Send me the sysdiagnose.

DO you want it sent as attachment here or direct to your email? I don't see your full email address and not sure wise to put the report out on the forum here. Advice appreciated on how to proceed. Have the report built now.

You can use dropbox or google drive or just email it to me.

it might be a bit large, so I recommend using Dropbox, Google Drive, or MailDrop.

Hmm. There is no X11.bin process running, which would explain why you're timing out connecting. The stub tries to launch the server directly:

    Nov  6 14:10:20 schnide3.oit.umn.edu org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.stub[46430]: Xquartz: Starting X server: /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 --listenonly

but there is no evidence that anything actually happens as a result.

What happens if you run this at the terminal:

    $ /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11

what about this:

    $ /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

BTW, you can unshare the sysdiagnose now. I have it.

First instance:
$ /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
(nothing happens)

$ open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11
(new terminal window opens and has)
/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 ; exit;
schnide3:~ jps$ /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 ; exit;
schnide3:~ jps$

Next try:
$ /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

It opens and runs!

If I quit and click on X11 in dock, it does one bounce and quits. At least now I have a workaround.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *Invalid*

Ok, so that indicates that something is wrong with your shell environment.

Take look at /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11 (it basically just execs X11.bit with your shell environment). Thus something is likely wrong with your ~/.profile or similar.

I have had this same issue. The reason is that I override the shell using my .profile:

    exec /opt/local/bin/bash --noprofile --rcfile ~/.customrc

/opt/local/bin/bash (from MacPorts) has the advantage that it offers tab completion in MacPorts-installed packages, such as Git.

I solved the problem by creating a ~/.x11run executable, as suggested by the X11 startup script:

    #! /opt/local/bin/bash

    exec /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin - /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin

The "disadvantage" is that xterm doesn't start when you launch X11.app directly. This can be "repaired" by omitting the two arguments in the invocation of /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin. However, if you do that, xterm is *always* started with X11, whether directly or through another app.

Suggestions for smarter solutions are welcome.

Doing that in your .profile is not the way to override your shell and is bound to lead to TONS of issues. Just change your shell in User Settings. Right click on the user, choose "Advanced Options" and then set your shell.
