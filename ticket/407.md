Hang in X11
===========


I was working along when suddenly XQuarts 2.5.1 RC1 locked up. The windows would not respond. I was able to Quit from the menu. I am attaching a sample of it at the hang point. I guess it wasn't totally hung, because I did Quit but the windows were not responding, could not bring to the front or move around at all. It acted like there was a hidden modal window being displayed somewhere. I have multiple virtual screens.

Can you please try with 2.5.1\_rc2? Do you have specific steps to reproduce this? The sample looks like XQuartz.app is behaving correctly. Are you sure that XQuartz.app was locked up and not the application you were running within it? Did you try launching another X11 application while in this state?
