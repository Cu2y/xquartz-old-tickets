No window displayed by X Server
===============================


Hi,

Just installed XQuartz 2.7.5 (xorg-server 1.14.4) on OS 10.9.
The server is launched correctly (its icon appears active in the Dock and the menu bar shows the usual menus (X11, Applications, ...).
But nothing happens when i try to launch an application (Xterm, xlogo, ...).
When switching to full screen mode, i get a black screen.

ps -ef shows (among others) these three lines :

     502   368     1   0  5:46   ??         0:00.01 /bin/sh /opt/X11/bin/startx -- /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz
      502   429   368   0  5:46   ??         0:00.00 /opt/X11/bin/xinit /opt/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc -- /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz :0 -nolisten tcp -auth /Users/jserot/.serverauth.368
      502   430   429   0  5:46   ??         0:00.01 /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz :0 -nolisten tcp -auth /Users/jserot/.serverauth.368
      502   527   429   0  5:46   ??         0:00.04 /opt/X11/bin/quartz-wm

The DISPLAY env var exists and contains ":0.0".

I've rebooted several times since the installation of XQuartz w/o any change.

System log contains the following line :

19/01/2014 17:46:22,293 org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.stub\[430\]: launch\_msg("CheckIn") IPC failure: Operation not permitted

Thx for the help

-   **Resolution** set to *behaves correctly*

Sounds like everything is behaving correctly. Have you actually launched an X11 client? If you don't have a client that is drawing a window, there won't be any windows drawn... Try launching an xterm (cmd-n).
