RandR fullscreen not working
============================


When I use anything that uses RandR to go to fullscreen at a custom resolution, the screen remains black and I can't interact with the application. The cursor remains visible, but that's it. If I use the shortcut ⌘⌥A the app functions normally out of fullscreen, but refuses to go back into fullscreen.

Tested in both XQuartz 2.7.4 and 2.7.5\_rc1 on both a MacBook Pro 13-inch Late 2011 and an iMac 20-inch Early 2008.

Seems to be working fine for me.

    1) Opened an xterm
    2) Ran 'xrandr1920x1200' in the xterm

XQuartz went fullscreen, the xterm was visible, and I could interact with it

Hm, yeah odd. Sorry. I think it's a problem with wine now that I've done more experimenting. Although it only happens in XQuartz and not WineskinX11, and happens with both the wineskin wrapper and the command-line version, I found that the problem doesn't appear if I override the display settings in wineskin, suggesting it's a problem with how wine requests the screen change. Again, sorry :)
