Unfortunately, this isn't a bug in quartz-wm... It's a bug in some of the APIs that quartz-wm uses... this makes it impossible for me to fix, but I've been pushing to get this addressed for the past couple months.

Actually, it looks like I can probably handle this with just an offset to workaround any outside bug... so I'm going to try that...

Gravity, for the most part, is working correctly... the problem seems to be that the inner rect is used for calculating placement rather than the outer rect.
