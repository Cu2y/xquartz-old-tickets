quartz-wm needs leopard titlebar
================================


This is a fairly minor aesthetic complaint, but is there any good reason that X11 applications I run look like they're running in Tiger? The shadows are off and the window decorations don't look like the new ones. It's obvious that everyone knows this exists, but I couldn't find any bug about it or anything in the mailing list so I thought I'd post a ticket.

-   **Version** set to *2.1.4 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Component** changed from *xserver* to *x11-apps*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.2.0*

Heh... you're right. I didn't even realize there wasn't a bug report here. It's a known issue. In fact, it's something I've been working on today actually. I am making strides towards solving this, but a final solution might require changes to code outside the prevue of X11. I have this targeted as a 2.2.0 milestone, but it will probably fall to 2.2.1 or later.
