Latest update fails the test
============================


Your latest update (2/11/2011) is causing major problems for me. It installed during a Gimp session and now won't load properly. XQuartz just goes in to a loop. Loads and quits, loads and quits, non-stop. Can't Force Quit it. Can't even Shut Down, as XQuartz cancels it. Forced to pull the plug..............

I've shut down the Mac three times now.

I have no idea what version it is, as it won't stay up long enough to check!
