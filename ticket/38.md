-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

This is fixed in git. You can test it via this application:

\#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;

int main() {

> Display \*dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
> XBell(dpy, 100);
> XFlush(dpy);

}

If the bell continues to not sound, then it is a problem with the application itself and not the server.
