X11-2.2.1.pkg makes iMac unbootable
===================================


Yesterday I installed the new X11-2.2.1.pkg, after which I found my early
2006 iMac to be unbootable. Thank the gods for Time Machine.
I have looked around a bit and found no reports of this version of X11
being a "bad thing." Anyone here have trouble with that version?
Sorry, but I have no logs to check, because Time machine doesn't back
these up.

The symptom I got upon rebooting was alternating screens of slightly
different shades of blue, one of which contained that little spinner
thingy. Seemingly, something was trying repeatedly to run and repeatedly
crashing.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Version** changed from *2.2.0 (xserver-1.3)* to *2.2.1 (xserver-1.3)*
-   **Resolution** set to *worksforme*

Uhm... there's really nothing about X11 which could possibly do that. Can you please reinstall it and try again.
