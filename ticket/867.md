Cannot use CTRL+c in xterm
==========================


CTRL c is mapped to the copy by the edit menu of X11 and cannot be used for normal terminal signaling. Using CTRL+SHIFT+c does what I would expect (and I guess every UNIX user would) the CTRL+c to do. Why not have COMMAND+c be the copy for X11 like it is for every other MAC application, CTRL+c for copy smells a lot like microsoft, and no one likes them ;-).

It is.
