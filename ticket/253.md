Spaces broken with 2.3.3\_rc4
=============================


Here's the scenario:

-   I have all my X11 windows in space 1;
-   I go to some other app in another space;
-   I switch back to X11 with either cmd-tab or the dock, I get my X11 windows in the current space instead of going back to space 1.

Are your windows override-redirect? This should only be happening with windows that are override-redirect (like menus and tooltips).

Yeah, I can't reproduce this.

-   Move to space 4
-   Open Mail.app
-   Move to space 1
-   Open X11.app
-   Create 2 xterms in space 1
-   Click on Mail in the dock, we move to space 4
-   Click on X11 in the dock, we move to space 1

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

I was able to reproduce it and a fix will be in the final 2.3.3
