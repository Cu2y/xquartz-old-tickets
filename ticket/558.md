X11/Pasteboard: Need to toggle preferences after login to activate
==================================================================


When trying to put an image using XDnD protocoll on the clipboard (see attached source), it get synched to the pasteboard only if I toggle any of the X11 Preferences Pasteboard options (i.e. Enable syncing). Once i toggle a setting the sync works during that login session (even restarting X11). Once i log out and in again i have to toggle the setting again to enable the synching. The saved preferences in the panel show after login that syncing is enabled, but does not work until i toggle them off/on.

The attached program can be used to show the problem. Just compile it with "cc -o png2clip png2clip.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11" and run it with png2clip test.png (any png image is fine). The image will not appear in e.g. Finder | Edit | Show Clipboard, or Preview, other Mac programs unless the Preferences are toggled once in the login session. The same is also true for e.g. gimp and maybe even text on the clipboard, but i did not check that out as closely.

This happens with XQuartz 2.6.3, 2.7.1, 2.7.2 beta123.

Yeah, I've heard this before. Can you verify that if you login and copy something from a non-X11 application, then you start X that it works fine? I've heard of that before, but I've never been able to test this case. Thanks for the sample code and explicit steps. I'll see if I'm able to reproduce this now.

Yes that is correct. If a non-X11 application puts an image into the clipboard (i tried preview of a png img, selected a part of it, edit copy, verified with Finder | Show Clipboard), and then starting X11 and using X application to put something else onto the clipboard/pasteboard, it will be shown then in the Finder Clipboard right away (no toggling of X11 preferences then needed).

I did this test on OSX 10.7.3, XQuartz 2.6.3. I can later try on 2.7.2 beta3

tried on 2.7.2 beta3. Same behaviour, if a non-X11 application puts something on the clipboard after login, following X11 clipboard copies are fine as well.
