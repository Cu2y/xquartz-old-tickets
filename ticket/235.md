Xlib: "No protocol specified" crash
===================================


Hello,

Since the upgrade from tiger to leopard our mac's are not able to connect to our ubuntu server. We need this connection to use some genetics software.
After a long wait and downloading the latest versions of XQuartz, we still can't get it done. I'm not a code guru and command driven software is always acrabadacra for me.
I hope someone can help me with this.
The message below is displayed in the terminal window. The last few lines, get repeated numerous times before the connection is declared dead.

Xquartz: X11.app = /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.4.0*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *invalid*

Please join the x11-users mailing list (click on the Mailing Lists link to the left). This is not a bug.

When you mail the list, please tell us how you're trying to connect. The output for the server starting should not appear in a Terminal window, so you're doing something in a non-standard way. The way they connect to your ubuntu server should be just 'ssh -Y &lt;their login&gt;@&lt;your server&gt;' and as long as you have your sshd\_config configured properly to allow X11 forwarding, they can just run whatever command they want.
