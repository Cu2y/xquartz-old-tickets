mouse using in gnuplot
======================


Using gnuplot with the term x11, I can't use the mouse for to zoom and rotate the graph.
And also the pointer for the coordinates doesn't work.
It's a problem of my pc (i've a Mac with OS X Mountain Lion) or it' a bug?
And what can I do to fix it?

I'm italian and maybe my English is not so good. If necessary i'll write in Italian!
Thank you.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

This seems to have nothing to do with XQuartz. Please file a bug with gnuplot.
