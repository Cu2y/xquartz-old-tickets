Fullscreen Mode Issues (still) with 2.3.2.1 (2009.01.03 release)
================================================================


Hello,

I was having issues getting the X11 full screen mode to work at all in the currently shipping version from Apple for Mac OS X 10.5.6. I tried loading the Tiger X11 package available on the Apple web site and configuring my system such that I could switch back and forth between the two in accordance with a newsgroup entry I found from Ben Byer. Still no luck (I could select full screen mode with the old release, however, I still could not get the common desktop environment to display from my OpenVMS or Unix hosts).

I then found the latest release (2.3.2.1) on the XQuartz site with details indicating fullscreen mode was now working. I downloaded and installed the package, set X11 for full screen mode in Preferences and I still cannot get my Common Desktop Environment to display. I get the light blue screen and a message stating that it is starting, however, I don't get the login dialog box and after 4 minutes my session presumably times out and exits. This is essentially the same behavior I see with any of the versions if I am running without full screen mode.

If I am missing a configuration option and this issue is indeed resolved, I would greatly appreciate any feedback.

Best Regards,

Ted Allen

This is not a bug in XQuartz.

You can either use XDMCP and login to your remote box, or you can start X11 without a WM, then ssh to your remote box and start the WM from there.

Please join the x11-users list for assistance.
