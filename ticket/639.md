Please attach a system profile (saved from Apple Menu-&gt;About-&gt;More Info).

Please provide a screenshot.

What version change introduced this issue (ie: what was the first version of XQuartz that didn't work and the last version that did?)

Does this just affect GLX applications or normal X11 windows as well?

Please be a bit more specific with your issue as there is a lot of room for ambiguity in your statement.

I am able to reproduce this same problem with Mac OS X 10.8.2 and XQuartz 2.7.3.

For me, it was upgrading to Mac OS X 10.8.2. After upgrading, I started XQuartz (2.7.3) and got the blue tint coloring for my entire screen. I tried XQuartz 2.7.4\_rc1, but the problem remained.

It happens for normal X11 windows.

I also noticed the same blue-tint-screen thing happens when playing a video with Adobe Flash Player in Safari.

So, it's possible this is not a problem specific to XQuartz.

In fact, it might be a problem with automatic graphics switching. I found the post by Umputun in this Apple discussion helpful:

Following Umputun's suggestion solved this problem for me. Now I can start XQuartz, and it does not cause the blue-tint screen.
