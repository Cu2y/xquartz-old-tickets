AIGLX: segmentation fault in remote graphics program (IDL)
==========================================================


I've found a bug in macosx X11 libGL, which is present in Leopard's X11, Snow Leopard's X11 and XQuartz X11 &gt; version 2.3.2. When running a mathematics and graphics program called IDL, the program crashes when a graphics window is opened when doing so remotely (I use an ssh connection). Opening a window results in a segmentation fault, while doing so running idl in 32-bit (idl -32) results in a bus error.

I traced it down to one file: libGL.1.2
When I replace this file with an older one, from XQuartz version 2.3.2, the problem dissapears, so I suspect the problem was introduced with the OpenGL changes to version 2.3.3.

I hope this helps to solve the problem.

-   **Milestone** set to *OpenGL.framework DRI*

Well, I'm not sure what is going on here, but I need quite a bit more information. For one thing, your idl is not linked against /usr/X11/libGL.1.2.dylib:

    22        0x100a82000 -        0x100ac0fff +libMesaGLU6_2.dylib ??? (???) /Applications/Math/itt/idl706/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64/libMesaGLU6_2.dylib
    23         0x100ac5000 -        0x100db1fff +libMesaGL6_2.dylib ??? (???) /Applications/Math/itt/idl706/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64/libMesaGL6_2.dylib
    24         0x100e19000 -        0x100e28ff7 +libOSMesa6_2.dylib ??? (???) /Applications/Math/itt/idl706/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64/libOSMesa6_2.dylib

so I'm not sure what is going on here internal to IDL. As far as I can tell, this is just another "AIGLX doesn't work" issue, and AIGLX is not currently supported very well. You can try the 2.4.1\_alpha1 release which has a bit better support for AIGLX, but at this point, I need reproducible test cases that I can run, compile, and debug in order to get it more stable.

As for IDL segfaulting when it doesn't get AIGLX the way it wants it, that needs to be reported to the IDL developers. The backtrace clearly shows it crashing in IDL and not libGL.

Ok. I wasn't sure how this is working.

The link to libGL.1.2.dylib is thru /usr/X11/libGL.1.dylib, which is a soft link. If I change this to link to an older version of libGL.1.2.dylib the problem dissappears, so that's what I use now as a work-around. I suspect it's connected to remote login, because everything works fine locally, but I have no idea what the problem may be, just thought I'd report this.

What system are you changing /usr/X11/libGL.1.dylib? The local system with the X11 server running, or the remote system with the X11 client (IDL) running?

AFAICT, changing either should have no effect. The IDL binary isn't linking against it, and the server has no use for it...

From IDL Developers:

    We were thinking, as a first a quick test, if the user could remove or
    re-name two GL libraries (if the user is using IDL 7.1.1) located in:

    /Applications/ITT/idl71/bin/bin.darwin.i386/gl_driver.so
    /Applications/ITT/idl71/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64/gl_driver.so

    Let me know then if by removing those libraries the behavior changes.
    Thanks.

This works! When I remove these two files IDL behaves normally. Thanks.

Also, I found I mixed up two crash reports, I now attached the one I used to tackle the problem at first. This crash report has 13 lines with libs in /usr/X11/lib, and I changed them to see which one gave the problem, assuming it would be only one. That led me to /usr/X11/libGL.1.dylib. Sorry for any confusion.

And thanks for taking this up with ITT.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *fixed*

Ok, so the problem is that our libGL.dylib fails to get a GLX context when it's a remote client, and then it crashes rather than returning this error to the caller.

This should be fixed in r371

Since IDL uses the system /usr/X11/lib/libGL.dylib, it will take an Apple Software Update to address this in the shipping product.

The "real" solution will be getting indirect accelerated GLX working in our libGL, but there's already a bug reported for this problem.
