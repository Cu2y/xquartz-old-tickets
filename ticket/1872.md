Make sure you have a current release.

You probably upgraded a machine that was running a pre-Yosemite release, and that had XQuartz installed, to Yosemite. If so, this is a bug in the Yosemite installer; it trashes the /usr/X11 -&gt; /opt/X11 and /usr/X11R6 -&gt; /opt/X11 symlinks that the XQuartz installer carefully placed in order to allow programs built against the normal /usr/X11R6 or /usr/X11 paths to run.

Try manually doing "sudo ln -s /opt/X11 /usr/X11" and "sudo ln -s /opt/X11 /usr/X11R6" to work around the installer bug.
