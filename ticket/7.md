An observation, to add me to the cc list. :-)

Xquartz itself seems to go fullscreen without any problem; in fact it's the opposite I have a problem with; I can't select to run Xquartz rootless in order to supply a -size.

Xquartz by default starts a server with a single "screen" spanning all actual displays,which makes for a difficult user experience when trying to run something \*in\* it fullscreen (like Xephyr -fulscreen -query). But this probably belongs better in the Xinerama bug. On a single display fullscreen seems OK to me.

Still didn't do it... maybe this time. This isn't a nice bugtracking interface!

Jeremy, any suggestions as to what needs to be investigated to make this work? I see there's been great progress here, keep up the good work.

It would be really nice to have true fullscreen in rootless mode. This is different than rooted fullscreen support (which would also be great) and so could be implemented faster. What I mean is for a window to be able to cover the entire screen (including mac menu bar and dock) in rootless mode. For example, eye of gnome (eog) has a fullscreen mode that in linux makes it cover the entire screen including the gnome panels (i.e., menus). When used on mac in rootless mode it covers most of the screen but not the menu bar. I'm not sitting at my leopard machine so I cannot remember what it does with the dock when not hidden, but I know if the dock is hidden then it correctly uses all the space to the bottom of the window.

The behavior of covering the menu bar and dock is exactly what many Mac OS X applications do when in "fullscreen" mode. For example iPhoto, Dvd Player, and iMovie to name a few. Why shouldn't X11 applications have the same behavior. Is X11 a 2nd class citizen?

I realize that this request is different than what this feature request is asking for but since it falls under the same general area I've added it to this bug.

A little progress has been made towards X11 fullscreen mode like we had in Tiger. 2.3.2\_beta2 should have something usable.

-   **Resolution** set to *fixed*

I'm calling this fixed. If there are issues in 2.3.2\_beta2, a new report should be opened.
