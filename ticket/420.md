withdrawing a window in X11 causes the DRI surface to refer to a destroyed CG context
=====================================================================================


I've compiled the backgammon program gnubg, which uses X11, gtk2, gtkglext, ....

When I'm viewing the board using the 3D view and I select the Full Screen option from the program's View menu, the gnubg window expands to fill my screen but the board disappears, leaving only a white rectangle. The text (attached) appears in my Terminal window; the dated error messages coincide with my attempt to switch to Full Screen.

I'm using OS X 10.6.4 on a White Macbook, but the same issue occurs on my Nehalem Mac Pro. This bug has been present for some time, and I'm wondering if it's an X11 problem. I'm now using XQuartz 2.5.1\_rc1 (xorg-server 1.8.1).

You said that "this bug has been present for some time" ... has this bug always been present, or did this work with some older release? If it worked before, can you give me an idea of when it last worked?

Since January 2010 or thereabouts. See <http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-gnubg@gnu.org/msg05417.html>

Apparently that old version was built without 3d board (see the configure flags in the portfile). You can get a Leopard version at <http://www.gnubg.org/index.php?itemid=98>

The options you need are accessible via the View menu.

So 2.4.0 worked on Leopard? Does the X11.app in SnowLeopard have this problem as well?

Ah... can you try relinking the binary against the libraries in /opt/X11/lib ... I think this is a problem that has already been fixed, but hasn't shipped in SL yet.

yeah... so I built it, and it crashes on launch... so I'm going to have to come back to this a bit later...

Here's what I did:

I just built a new binary. The problem is present using both the X11 that came with SL (Quartz 2.3.5 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple53)) and XQuartz 2.5.1\_rc1 (xorg-server 1.8.1). Here are the linked libraries, which were supplied by Macports:

The reason I wanted you to use the libraries in /opt/X11 is to pick up the new libXplugin. You're not doing that since /opt/local/lib/libGL.dylib uses the system libXplugin.

Try this instead as it may be easier for you:

    sudo cp /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib.bak
    sudo cp /opt/X11/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib
    sudo install_name_tool -id /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib /usr/lib/libXplugin.1.dylib

Sorry for not understanding your earlier request.

No good. I used the three commands above and then rebuilt gnubg from source just as before. The errors remain (see below). Any harm in *not* undoing the libXplugin swap?

Nah, you can just leave it as it is...

how are you building gnubg? Are you doing the same thing I did? Can you please help me build a version that runs and reproduces this problem?

Thanks...

one possibility is that this is the "CGL context gets nuked when an X11 window is unmapped" bug. If they create the GLX context before entering fullscreen...

That problem stems from the fact that we have to destroy the CGWindow and thus nuke the CGLContext associated with the GLX context, but the GLX app thinks it is still valid. We need some glue to create a new CGLContext when the window is unmapped (such as when entering fullscreen which unmaps the window in order to remove the parent window which provides the window borders).

Do you know if that is the case? Is there a way you can try starting in fullscreen as opposed to switching to fullscreen?

oh, and you may have started to see this in January because that's around when quartz-wm started supporting the fullscreen hints... before, it wouldn't switch to fullscreen.

I can't comment on the technical stuff, but I've sent you the email address of the gnubg "leader". As for starting in fullscreen mode, I'm not sure. There are some command line options that may be relevant, but I'm not sure. Perhaps the --screen option? Don't know what to set it to, though.

Well, here's what I'm doing, having gotten all the dependencies installed by Macports. By the way, there seems to be a problem with the latest ports of gtk2 and gtkglext, so I needed to downgrade both to previous versions. That is I have

gtk2 @2.18.6\_0+universal+x11 (active)
gtkglext @1.2.0\_3+universal (active)

I get the latest snapshot from <http://www.gnubg.org/media/sources/>

I immediately edit autogen.sh, making libtoolize into glibtoolize

Then ./autogen.sh

Then ./configure --enable-threads CFLAGS="-arch i386" LDFLAGS="-arch i386"

Then make

Then sudo make install, which puts the gnubg files in /usr/local/ by default

Then /usr/local/bin/gnubg -w to execute.

These steps work for me on OS X 10.6.4 with the latest Xcode.

Ok, I'm able to build it now... so something strikes me as odd...

you can switch from fullscreen to windowed and you can switch in "2D" mode to fullscreen as well...

but it looks like the "2D" mode is still using GLX, so I'm curious what is different between the "2D" and "3D" modes that would cause this problem.

In any event, atleast I can reproduce it, and it does look like the problem I mentioned above.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
