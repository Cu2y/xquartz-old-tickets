xquartz drops ssh tunnel after period of inactivity
===================================================


I have found that version 2.7.4 drops the X11 SSH tunnel after a period of inactivity.

Reverting to version 2.7.3 resolved the problem.

The error message I got from the remote end of the SSH connection when trying to start a X11 client was that the port specified via DISPLAY was not available or not usable.

Actually... it looks like 2.7.3 has some flavor of the issue as well... I left an ssh connection open over night (with 2.7.3) and this morning I was able to open an emacs session (using X11) from that connection so I thought 2.7.3 did not have the problem, but I just saw the error again:

Display localhost:12.0 unavailable, simulating -nw

This is still with 2.7.3. I never saw this error before I upgraded (and then downgraded) to (and from) 2.7.4. However... it could also be that this is due to settings on our new RHEL6 box... which I started using at the same time. I'll try to verify this one way or the other... ...actually, odds are good that it is this new machine that is dropping the connection so the best course of action is probably to close this issue and have me reopen it if I can eliminate the RedHat host as the source of the problem.

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

This is an ssh feature and has nothing to do with XQuartz. Check out the ssh\_config man page.

Specifically, ForwardX11Timeout
