XQuartz 2.7.5\_rc4 installation failures on Mountain Lion
=========================================================


XQuartz-2.7.5\_rc4.dmg on OS X 10.8.5.

The resulting XQuartz.app is 2.7.5\_rc4 but installation reportedly fails:

… 

    Nov 10 11:20:35 gpes3e-gjp4.local installd[3508]: PackageKit: Install Failed: Error Domain=PKInstallErrorDomain Code=120 "An unexpected error occurred while moving files to the final destination." UserInfo=0x7fe114cb7c40 {NSUnderlyingError=0x7fe11521f470 "The operation couldn’t be completed. Directory not empty", NSLocalizedDescription=An unexpected error occurred while moving files to the final destination., arguments=(

…

The previously installed release candidate was probably from XQuartz-2.7.5\_rc1.dmg

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** set to *invalid*

The error is:

    Nov 10 11:20:14 gpes3e-gjp4.local shove[3874]: [source=file] failed _RelinkFile(/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/Cleanup At Startup/PKInstallSandboxManager/1.sandbox/Root/opt/X11/lib/X11/fontconfig/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf, /opt/X11/lib/X11/fontconfig/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf): Directory not empty

That's a bizarre error message, and I don't think there's much I can do about that...

Try nuking /opt/X11 and reinstalling ... feel free to ask on the mailing list if you need more help.

Did you figure out the issue with your installation crashing?

Thanks,
