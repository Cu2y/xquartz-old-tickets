GTK tooltips / Tooltips Bug
===========================


The problem described in this old post (below) was already annoying before Leopard and its Spaces but now with Spaces on, it gets worse:

<http://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2003/Jan/msg00190.html>

1.  Open a GTK app in one Space, an app which would make a tooltip appear when the cursor is over some position X
2.  Go to another space and watch the GTK tooltips appear when leaving the cursor stand still long enough over that position X

The annoyance caused by this bug is amplified when you tie X11 to one space. Any tooltip trigger will cause Spaces to switch to the other space immediately, so that any mouse use on another space may cause you to be moved back to the X11 space seemingly randomly.

To reproduce:

-   Open 'Exposé and Spaces' in System Preferences
-   On the Spaces tab, add an Application Assignment for /Applications/Utilities/X11, set it to one space.
-   Open a GTK application with tooltips, not coordinates where a tooltip occurs
-   Observe a switch to the space with the GTK application
-   Switch to another space, put mouse on same coordinates

I think the short-term fix for this might be to just disable passing mouse location information to X while it is in the background. That will annoy some focus-follow-mouse folks, but their usage is less common and can be addressed in 3.0

Any update on this, Jeremy? Your short-term fix sounds reasonable.

Thanks!

This is pretty much fixed in git (which will be in 2.3.2\_beta2)
