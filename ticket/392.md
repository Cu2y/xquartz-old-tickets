X11 windows come to front with mouse click in non-X11 window
============================================================


This occurs only after the screen or computer goes to sleep and the mouse is clicked or a key is pressed to wake the computer or unblank the screen.

I am running 2.5.1\_beta3, but this bug was also in 2.5.0, and the two previous beta 2.51s. I have a latest revision 13" MBP.

If there are open X11 windows (i.e. not minimized), they come to the front even though they were not when the computer went to sleep or the screen blanked. The menu bar does not change--i.e. it stays as the program (such as Safari) that was on top when the computer went to sleep (or the screen blanked). Also, clicks on the window section of the application which was supposed to be on top, do not bring the window back to the front. I have to click on the status bar or the top area of the window (the area that lets you drag the window around the screen).
