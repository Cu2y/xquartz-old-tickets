XQuartz 2.6.3 + NX causes hang, regression from 2.6.1
=====================================================


XQuartz 2.6.3 + NX 3.5.0-7 connecting to Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (connecting in floating window mode)

Problem repros with XQuartz 2.6.3, 2.6.2. Note that XQuartz 2.6.1 works fine.

Open any window that \*resizes during opening\* causes a hard hang to all NX windows. No user input accepted and pressing the "close" button on any of the nx floating windows does nothing. All I can do is quit NX and restart my connection. This occurs on several different applications, so it is not application specific.

-   **Keywords** *regression* added
-   **Priority** changed from *Not Set* to *Important*
-   **Milestone** set to *2.7.1*

Can you please try XQuartz 2.7.0\_rc1 and tell me if the problem happens there.

Can you sample your NX application so see where it is hanging?

Can you try using the older (working) version of quartz-wm with everything else updated? We need to determine if this is a bug in quartz-wm or the server.
