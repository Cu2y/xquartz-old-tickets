bad terminal redraw performance in osx lion for wide windows
============================================================


In OSX lion, when I have a terminal larger than about 1640 px, sometimes redraw slows down dramatically and it sometimes takes multiple seconds to redraw the entire screen.

Tried both xterm and urxvt installed from macports, they both exhibit this behavior.

In terms of redraw, I mean: run 'ls' a couple of times till it scrolls, clear the window, resize the window, or hide and show the window.

**Mass Edit**

As you may have noticed, we have had issues with spam in trac for the past couple years. We've decided to migrate to using freedesktop.org's bugzilla for our bug tracker (more details will be coming on the mailing lists in the next couple weeks).

I don't want us to loose valuable bug reports in the transition, so I want to make sure that any relevant open issues in this MacOSForge trac are migrated over to the new system. If you are interested in this issue, please take a few minutes to [file a new bug for this issue in bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=XQuartz&component=New%20Bugs). Please make sure to do the following:

-   Copy over all relevant information into that report, just in case we loose this one.
-   Set the URL field of the bugzilla report to this trac ticket's URL.
-   Paste the URL of the new bugzilla report as a comment in this ticket, and I'll close it out.
