No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding Problem
========================================================================


It appears that my issue is between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of XQuartz.

If this isn't an issue why does it cause a problem with the windows in my display- incomplete borders, and scroll bars?
See Pictures from 2 diff IMACS - one hasn't been updated.
Maybe its an SSH problem but just getting rid of the error message isn't going to solve this issue!

2.3.4XQuartz.png is GOOD

2.3.5XQuartz.png is USELESS!!!!!

-   **Status** changed from *new* to *closed*
-   **Resolution** changed from to *duplicate*

The missing borders issue is bug [\#⁠290](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/290) and has nothing to do with ssh.
