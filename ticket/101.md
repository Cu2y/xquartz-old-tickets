X11 does not honor shortcuts for moving windows between spaces
==============================================================


According to Mac Help:

To move a window from one space to another, use any of these shortcuts:

■ Press F8 to view all spaces, and then drag the window to the new space. To move all the windows belonging to the same application, press the Shift key while you drag the window.

■ Drag the window to the edge of your screen and pause; after a moment, the window is switched to the new space.

■ Move the pointer over the window, and hold down the mouse button while pressing the Control key and an arrow or number key.

So far as I can tell, only the first of these works for X11 windows.

2.2.1, not 2.2.0
